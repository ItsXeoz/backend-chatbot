    "question": "ruling on seeking refuge with allaah before reciting alfaatihah in the prayer",
    "answer": "praise be to allahfirstly \nit is proven \n    that the prophet  peace and blessings of allaah be upon him used to \n    seek refuge with allaah before reciting alfaatihah in the prayer narrated \n    by abu dawood 775 and classed as saheeh by alalbaani \nsecondly \nthe scholars \n    differed as to the ruling on seeking refuge with allaah before reciting \n    alfaatihah in the prayer some of them were of the view that it is \n    obligatory this is the view of ata althawri alawzaai and dawood as \n    was narrated by ibn hazm in almuhalla 3247248 and it was the \n    view favoured by him it was also narrated from ahmad and was favoured by \n    ibn battah as it says in alinsaaf 2119 among later scholars \n    this view was favoured by shaykh alalbaani may allaah have mercy on them \n    all  \nothers were \n    of the view that it is only mustahabb and is not obligatory this is the \n    view of the majority of scholars among the sahaabah and taabieen and of the \n    imams abu haneefah and alshaafai and ahmad according to the well known \n    view of his madhhab \nsee \n    tabyeen alhaqaaiq 1107 almajmoo 3280282 almughni \n    1283 alfataawa alkubra by ibn taymiyah 5332 \nthose who \n    say that it is obligatory quoted as evidence the verse in which allaah says \n    interpretation of the meaning \nso when \n    you want to recite the quraan seek refuge with allaah from shaytaan \n    satan the outcast the cursed one\nalnahl \n    1698\nthey said \n    in this verse there is the command to seek refuge with allaah and the basic \n    principle is that a command means that something is obligatory so long as \n    there is no other evidence to indicate that what is meant in the command is \n    mustahabb \nibn hazm \n    said in almuhalla 2279 \nwith regard \n    to the view of abu haneefah and alshaafai that seeking refuge with allaah \n    is not obligatory this is wrong because allaah may he be exalted says\n    so when you want to recite the quraan seek refuge with allaah from \n    shaytaan satan the outcast the cursed one when allaah commands \n    something it is wrong for anyone to say without any evidence from the \n    quraan or sunnah that this is not obligatory especially his command to \n    pray for him to protect us from the tricks of the shaytaan  so this command \n    is definitely obligatory because avoiding the shaytaan and fleeing from him \n    and asking for protection against him are things that no one can dispute are \n    obligatory moreover allaah has enjoined that upon us when reading quraan \n    end quote \nthe majority \n    of scholars responded by noting that there is other evidence which indicates \n    that it is mustahabb rather than obligatory this other evidence is \n1  the \n    hadeeth about the man who did not pray properly the prophet  peace and \n    blessings of allaah be upon him taught him how to pray and said when you \n    go to pray say takbeer then recite whatever you can of the quraan then \n    bow  narrated by albukhaari and muslim 397 and he did not tell him to \n    seek refuge with allaah \nimam \n    alshaafai said in alumm 1208 \nif he omits \n    it by mistake or out of ignorance or deliberately he does not have to \n    repeat it or do the prostration of forgetfulness but i regard it as makrooh \n    to omit it deliberately if he omits it in the first rakah i prefer for \n    him to say it in some other rakah the only thing that keeps me from \n    telling him to repeat the prayer is the fact that when the prophet  \n    peace and blessings of allaah be upon him taught a man what is sufficient \n    in prayer he said say takbeer then recite and it is not narrated that \n    he told him to seek refuge with allaah or recite the opening duaa this \n    indicates that the messenger of allaah  peace and blessings of allaah \n    be upon him regarded the opening duaa as something optional and that \n    seeking refuge with allaah is something that does not invalidate the prayer \n    if it is omitted end quote \n2 it says \n    in almawsooah alfiqhiyyah 46 \nthe majority \n    quoted as evidence that the command means that it is recommended and not \n    obligatory the fact that the salaf were unanimously agreed that it is \n    sunnah end quote  \nthe scholars \n    of the standing committee for issuing fatwas also favoured the view that it \n    is mustahabb and not obligatory as did shaykh ibn uthaymeen \nit says in\n    fataawa allajnah aldaaimah 6383 \nwhat is the \n    ruling on one who forgets to seek refuge with allaah from the accursed \n    shaytaan and remembers after finishing the prayer if he remembers that he \n    did not say aoodhu billaahi min alshaytaan ilrajeem i seek refuge \n    with allaah from the accursed shaytaan whilst he was praying \nthey \n    replied \nseeing \n    refuge with allaah is sunnah and it does not matter if it is omitted from \n    the prayer whether deliberately or by mistake end quote \nshaykh ibn \n    uthaymeen was asked should one seek refuge with allaah in every rakah or \n    only in the first rakah \nhe replied \nseeking \n    refuge with allaah from the accursed shaytaan in prayer is sunnah \nthe scholars \n    may allaah have mercy on them differed as to whether one should seek \n    refuge with allaah in every rakah or only in the first rakah based on the \n    recitation in prayer  is it regarded as one recitation or is the recitation \n    in each rakah separate \nit seems to \n    me that the recitation in prayer is one recitation so one should seek \n    refuge with allaah in the first rakah unless there happens something that \n    requires seeking refuge with allaah such as if there come whispers from the \n    shaytaan waswaas because if whispers come from the shaytaan the \n    messenger  peace and blessings of allaah be upon him enjoined spitting \n    drily to the left three times and seeking refuge with allaah from the \n    accursed shaytaan end quote \nmajmoo \n    fataawa ibn uthaymeen 13110 \nthis view is \n    also favoured in the answer to question no \n    65847 \nand allaah \n    knows best"

    "question": "is it essential to recite the quran in sequence for one who wants to complete it",
    "answer": "praise be to allahit is mustahabb to read quran a great deal during ramadaan because it is the month of the quran allah may he be exalted says interpretation of the meaning \nthe month of ramadan in which was revealed the quran a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion between right and wrong albaqarah 2185\njibreel used to come to the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him every night in ramadaan and review the quran with him narrated by albukhaari 5 and muslim 4268 \nalbukhaari 4614 narrated from abu hurayrah may allah be pleased with him that jibreel used to review the quran with the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him once every year and he reviewed it with him twice in the year when he died this indicates that it is mustahabb to complete the quran and study it in ramadaan\n hence the salaf used to read quran a great deal during ramadaan following the example of the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him qataadah may allah have mercy on him used to complete the quran every seven nights all the time and every three nights in ramadaan and every two nights during the last ten days of ramadaan  \nibraaheem alnakhai used to complete the quran in ramadaan every three nights and in the last ten days every two nights \nalaswad may allah have mercy on him used to read the entire quran every two nights throughout the month end quote from majaalis shahr ramadaan by shaykh ibn uthaymeen may allah have mercy on him p 65 \nsecondly \nthe best is to read the quran in the order of soorahs as given in the mushaf which is the sequence in which jibreel reviewed the quran with the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him at the end of his life  \nsee altahbeer fi ilm altafseer by alsuyooti p 637 \nalnawawi may allah have mercy on him said in altibyaan \nthe scholars may allah have mercy on them said the best is to read it in the order in which it appears in the mushaf so he should read alfaatihah then albaqarah then aal imraan then alnisa until he ends with qul aoodhu bi rabbi lnaas sooratalnaas whether he is reciting it in prayer or otherwise it is also mustahabb if he recites one soorah to recite after it the soorah that comes after it so if he recites qul aoodhu bi rabbi lnaas sooratalnaas in the first rakah he should recite from albaqarah in the second \nthe evidence for that is that the order of soorahs given in the mushaf is for a reason so that order should be followed except in cases where it is narrated that there is an exception such as in fajr prayer on friday when aliflaammeem tanzeel soorat alsajdah is recited in the first rakah and hal ata soorat alinsaan in the second and the eid prayers when soorat qaaf and soorat alqamar may be recited \nif he recites them in a different order and recites one soorah then recites a soorah that comes before it or he recites a soorah that does not come straight after it that is permissible even if he is not doing what is best as for reciting a soorah from the end to the beginning there is no dispute that this is not allowed and is blameworthy because it is a distortion that detracts from the linguistic miracle of the quran and goes against the wisdom behind the order in which the verses appear \nend quote from alnawawi \nthere is a report from aaishah which indicates that it is not obligatory to read quran in sequence \nalbukhaari 4993 narrated that yoosuf ibn maahak said i was with aaishah the mother of the believers when an iraqi came to her and said o mother of the believers show me your mushaf she said why he said so that i may compile and arrange the quran according to it for people recite it with its soorahs not in proper order she said it does not matter which part you read first the first part of it to be revealed was a soorah from almufassal which mentioned paradise and hell then when the people became steadfast in islam rulings on halaal and haraam were revealed if the first thing to have been revealed was do not drink wine they would have said we will never give up wine if it had been revealed do not commit zina they would have said we will never give up zina it was revealed in makkah to muhammad peace and blessings of allah be upon him when i was a young girl playing nay but the hour is their appointed time for their full recompense and the hour will be more grievous and more bitter alqamar 5446 and soorat albaqarah and alnisa were not revealed except i was with him \nalhaafiz said \nit seems to me that this iraqi was one of those who followed the recitation of ibn masood when the mushaf of uthmaan was brought to kufa ibn masood did not agree to recant his recitation or destroy his mushaf and his compilation was different from that of uthmaans mushaf compilation means the collection of the mushaf in order undoubtedly the compilation of uthmaans mushaf was more appropriate than any other hence this iraqi said that its soorahs were not in proper order \nibn battaal said we do not know of anyone who regarded it as obligatory to recite the soorahs in order whether during prayer or otherwise rather it is permissible to recite alkahf before albaqarah or alhajj before alkahf for example as for what is narrated from the salaf about it being forbidden to recite the quran out of order what is meant by that is reciting a soorah from its end to its beginning there was a group which did that in poetry to demonstrate their precise memorization thereof so the salaf ruled that this is not allowed with regard to the quran and it is haraam alqaadi iyaad said the order of soorahs is not obligatory when reading or praying or studying or teaching hence mushafs varied but when the mushaf of uthmaan was written they wrote it in the order in which it appears now hence the order of the mushafs of the sahaabah varied then he mentioned something similar to ibn battaal end quote from fath albaari \nand allah knows best"

    "question": "is there any dua in the sunnah for after one has completed the quran",
    "answer": "praise be to allahthere is no specific ua narrated in the sunnah for after one has completed the quran or even from the companions of the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him or the wellknown imams one of the most wellknown uas regarding this matter is the ua which is written at the end of many mushafs and it attributed to shaykh alislam ibn taymiyah may allah have mercy on him but there is no basis for attributing it to him see fatawa alshaykh ibn uthaymeen 14226 \nthe ua after completing the quran is recited either after completing it whilst praying or when not praying there is no basis for reciting any ua after completing it whilst praying as for reciting a ua after completing it when not praying it is narrated that anas may allah be pleased with him did that \nshaykh ibn uthaymeen may allah have mercy on him was asked what is the ruling on making ua after completing the quran in night prayers in ramadaan  \nhe replied \ni do not know of any ua for completing the quran in night prayers in ramadaan either from the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him or from his companions the most that has been narrated concerning that is that when anas ibn maalik may allah have mercy on him had completed a reading of the quran he would gather his family and make ua this had to do with reading it outside of prayer end quote \nfataawa arkaan alislam p 354 \nshaykh bakr abu zayd wrote a useful essay on this issue at the end of which he said \nfrom the quotations in the two previous sections we may draw the following conclusion \n1  ua upon completion of the quran in general \nthe conclusion concerning this is as follows \nfirstly \nwhat we have stated above has to do with ua upon completion of the quran in general \nthere is no proof that the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him did that rather the reports are either mawdoo fabricated or are daeef weak with no other reports to strengthen them it is almost certain that there are no marfoo reports concerning this matter that can be relied upon because the scholars who wrote comprehensively about the sciences of the quran and the dhikrs to be recited in connection with the quran such as alnawawi ibn katheer alqurtubi and alsuyooti did not narrate anything other than what we have referred to above if they had known of any reports with stronger isnaads they would have quoted them\nsecondly \nthere is a saheeh report that anas ibn maalik may allah be pleased with him said ua when he completed the quran and he would gather his family and children for that and that a number of the taabieen followed him in that as mentioned in the report of mujaahid ibn jabr may allah have mercy on them all \nthirdly \nthere is no suggestion in the texts of imam abu haneefah and imam alshaafai may allah have mercy on them that this is islamically prescribed \nwhat is narrated from imam maalik may allah have mercy on him is that this is not something that the people did and that completing the quran in night prayers in ramadaan is not sunnah \nfourthly \nthe view that it is mustahabb to make ua after completing the quran is what is narrated from imam ahmad may allah have mercy on him as our hanbali scholars narrated from him and as was affirmed by some later scholars of the other three madhhabs \n2  ua following completion of the quran in prayer \nthis may be summed up as follows  \nfirstly \nfrom what is quoted above there is no one letter from the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him or from one of his companions may allah be pleased with them to indicate that it is islamically prescribed to recite this ua in prayer after completing the quran before or after bowing whether that is done by an imam or by one who is praying alone \nsecondly \nthe closest we can find on this matter is what was quoted by the scholars of our madhhab from the report from imam ahmad may allah have mercy on him according to the report of hanbal alfadl and alharbi the isnaad of which we cannot find about saying the ua for completing the quran in taraweeh prayer before bowing \naccording to another report narrated from him  the source of which is not known  he allowed it in the ua of witr \nsee marwiyaat ua khatm alquran \nand allah knows best"

    "question": "they read quraan before taraaweeh prayer then complete it in the prayer",
    "answer": "praise be to allah\n      there is nothing wrong with you having this gathering for \n      one person to read quraan whilst the others listen is something that is \n      prescribed in shareeah the prophet  peace and blessings of allaah \n      be upon him and his companions did that \n\n    it was narrated that ibn masood may allaah be pleased with \n    him said the prophet  peace and blessings of allaah be upon him said \n    to me recite quraan for me i said o messenger of allaah should i \n    recite it to you when it was revealed to you he said i like to hear it \n    from someone else so i recited soorat alnisa to him until i reached \n    this verse interpretation of the meaning \n\n    how will it be then when we bring from each nation a \n    witness and we bring you o muhammad as a witness against these people\n\n    alnisa 441\nhe said thats enough \n    for now and he turned to me with his eyes flowing with tears \n\n    narrated by albukhaari 4763 muslim 800 \n\n    shaykh abd alazeez ibn baaz said \n\n    it is prescribed for the muslims during this blessed month to \n    study the quraan together day and night following the example of the \n    prophet  peace and blessings of allaah be upon him with whom jibreel \n    used to study the quraan every year in ramadaan and he studied it with him \n    twice in the last year of his life and with the aim of drawing closer to \n    allaah and pondering the meanings of the book of allaah in order to benefit \n    from it and act upon it this is the way of the righteous salaf and the \n    believers male and female should occupy themselves with the quraan \n    reciting it pondering its meanings and referring to the books of tafseer in \n    order to benefit from it and learn more \n\n    majmoo fataawa alshaykh ibn baaz \n    11319 320 \nit is better when reading \n    quraan to also learn the rulings of the quraan and understand it \n    meanings so if you add to reading some tafseer commentary on what you \n    read or on part of it then you will combine many good things such as \n    following the sunnah studying the quraan together teaching the muslims \n    and helping them to ponder the quraan \n\n    if this completion of the quraan is done in taraaweeh prayer \n    that is better than it being done outside the prayer \n\n    shaykh alislam ibn taymiyah said in alfataawa alkubra \n    2297 \nthe command and \n    encouragement to recite quraan applies more to the one who is praying than \n    to anyone else for reciting the quraan in prayer is better than reciting \n    it outside of prayer the reports which speak of the virtue of the one who \n    recites quraan refer to the one who is praying more than anyone else end \n    quote \n\n    if it is difficult for the people to complete the quraan in \n    the prayer they can combine two good things studying the quraan before \n    the prayer and reciting the rest during the prayer as you are doing \n\n    it was narrated that ibn abbaas may allaah be pleased with \n    him said the messenger of allaah  peace and blessings of allaah be \n    upon him was the most generous of people and he was at his most generous \n    during ramadaan when jibreel would meet with him he would meet him on every \n    night of ramadaan and study the quraan with him and the messenger of \n    allaah  peace and blessings of allaah be upon him was as generous as \n    the wind in doing good \n\n    narrated by albukhaari 3048 muslim 2308 \n\n    shaykh abd alazeez ibn baaz may allaah have mercy on him \n    was asked \n\n    can it be understood from the fact that jibreel peace be \n    upon him studied quraan with the prophet  peace and blessings of \n    allaah be upon him every night in ramadaan that it is good to complete the \n    quraan in this month \n\n    he replied \n\n    it may be understood that it is mustahabb to study the \n    quraan and that the believer should study it with those who will benefit \n    him and help him because the messenger  peace and blessings of allaah \n    be upon him studied with jibreel peace be upon him for a reason because \n    jibreel was the one who had brought it from allaah so he was the emissary \n    between allaah and the messengers \n\n    undoubtedly the prophet  peace and blessings of allaah \n    be upon him would benefit from his study with jibreel such as learning the \n    variant recitations huroof of the quraan and the meanings intended by \n    allaah if a person studies with someone who will help him to understand the \n    quraan and help him to pronounce it properly this is what is desirable \n    just as the prophet  peace and blessings of allaah be upon him studied \n    it with jibreel the point is not that jibreel was better than the prophet \n     peace and blessings of allaah be upon him but jibreel was the \n    messenger who brought it from allaah and conveyed to the messenger  \n    peace and blessings of allaah be upon him that which allaah had commanded \n    him namely the quraan and its pronunciation and meanings so the prophet \n     peace and blessings of allaah be upon him benefited from jibreel in \n    these ways this does not mean that jibreel was better than the prophet  \n    peace and blessings of allaah be upon him for he is the best of mankind \n    and is better than the angels but there was a great deal of goodness in \n    their studying the quraan together for the prophet  peace and \n    blessings of allaah be upon him and for the ummah because it was studying \n    what had come from allaah in order to benefit from what had come from \n    allaah \n\n    there is another benefit in that which is that studying \n    together at night is better than doing so during the day because this study \n    used to take place at night and it is known that the night is better for \n    studying than the day because one is better able to focus and concentrate \n    then \n\n    another benefit is that studying together is prescribed in \n    shareeah and it is a righteous deed even if it is done at times other than \n    ramadaan because it benefits both parties even if there are more than two \n    it doesnt matter because each of them can benefit from his brothers and \n    they can encourage one another to read it may be that a person would not be \n    motivated to read if he sits on his own but if he has a companion or \n    companions to study with him that will encourage him to read as well as \n    the benefits they will all share of studying and learning together \n\n    it may be understood from that that the imams reading the \n    whole quraan to the congregation during ramadaan is a kind of this studying \n    together because it enables them to listen to the whole quraan hence imam \n    ahmad may allaah have mercy on him liked the one who was leading them in \n    prayer to complete the quraan with them this is akin to the practice of \n    the salaf who used to like to hear the whole of the quraan but this does \n    not mean that he should hasten and rush and not be deliberate in his reading \n    and humble focused and at ease in his prayer rather paying attention to \n    these matters is more important than reciting the entire quraan \n\n    majmoo fataawa alshaykh ibn baaz \n    11331333 \n\n    shaykh abd alazeez ibn baaz may allaah have mercy on him \n    was also asked \n\n    many imams are keen to complete the quraan in taraaweeh and \n    they strive to let the congregation hear the entire quraan is there \n    anything wrong with that \n\n    he replied \n\n    this is a good deed so the imam may recite a juz or less \n    each night then read more during the last ten nights so as to complete the \n    quraan this applies if it is easy for him to do so and will not cause any \n    hardship the great scholar ibn alqayyim may allaah have mercy on him \n    wrote a chapter in his book jala alafhaam filsalaati walsalaam ala \n    khayr alanaam in which he described how the salaf were keen to \n    complete the quraan we advise you to read this chapter

    "question": "he claims that the quraan is lacking in eloquence and contains grammatical errors",
    "answer": "praise be to allahfirstly \nthe one who is not able to engage in debate \n    with others should fear allaah and not get involved in debates and arguments with others rather he should try to protect his religious commitment \n    by refraining from arguing with the ignorant or those who promote specious arguments  \nsecondly \nwith regard to the specious arguments \n    mentioned  which are more flimsy than a spiders web  these may be answered in two ways \nthe first way is in general terms which is \n    to say that the quraan is the book of allaah which was revealed to the pure arabs who were the most advanced nation in the field of eloquence \n    they paid a great deal of attention to that and had reached a high level of eloquent selfexpression they had established festivals of poetry and \n    speechgiving they hung their muallaqaat poems on the kabah as a sign of the high esteem in which they held eloquence and literature they \n    competed in poetry and beautiful speech poetry flowed through their veins and they recited poems on all occasions for joy and sorrow birth and \n    death happiness and misery victory and defeat this was something that was unknown in any other nation \nhence by his wisdom allaah revealed to them \n    this quraan in this language of which they were so proud and because of which they thought themselves superior to other nations the quraan \n    dazzled them with its beautiful words and meanings its great purpose and structure so they submitted to it out of respect for its language and \n    dare not speak any word of criticism against its wording grammar or expression  \nallaah challenged them in his book to produce \n    anything like the quraan but they could not match it let alone find fault with its grammar allaah says interpretation of the meaning \nsay if the mankind and the jinn were \n    together to produce the like of this quraan they could not produce the like thereof even if they helped one another\n    alisra 1788\nthen allaah challenged them to produced ten \n    soorahs like it as he said interpretation of the meaning \nor they say he prophet muhammad \n    forged it the quraan say bring you then ten forged soorah chapters like unto it and call whomsoever you can other than allaah to your \n    help if you speak the truth\nhood 1113\nwhen they were unable to do that then allaah \n    challenged them to produce just one soorah like it allaah said interpretation of the meaning \nand if you arab pagans jews and \n    christians are in doubt concerning that which we have sent down ie the quraan to our slave muhammad then produce a soorah chapter of \n    the like thereof and call your witnesses supporters and helpers besides allaah if you are truthful\nalbaqarah 223\nno one who comes afterwards when the \n    language has become corrupted and mixed with foreign languages has any right to support such nonsensical ideas that do no more than point to the \n    depth of his ignorance and the shallowness of his thinking and his lack of knowledge of the arabic language as it was said  \nhow often do you see someone criticizing \n    something that is sound and his problem is that he cannot understand it properly \nthe second way is in specific detailed \n    terms discussing the aspects of eloquence in the words that he criticized this is as follows \nwith regard to the words of allaah \n    interpretation of the meaning \nsome you disbelieved and some you killed \n    fafareeqan kadhdhabtum wa fareeqan taqtuloon\nalbaqarah 287\nthe scholar altaahir ibn ashoor said in his \n    commentary altahreer waltanweer 1598 \nthe word taqtuloon translated as you \n    killed appears in the present tense form to emphasize more vividly the terrible action that they did namely killing the prophets this is like \n    the verse in which allaah says interpretation of the meaning \nand it is allaah who sends arsala  part \n    tense form the winds so that they raise up fa tutheeru  present tense form the clouds and we drive them to a dead land and revive therewith \n    the earth after its death\nfaatir 359\nmoreover the form taqtuloon fits with \n    the rhyme of the soorah and makes it more vivid this provides eloquence of meaning and beauty of form end of quote \nshaykh ibn uthaymeen quoted in his \n    tasfeer 1283 from some of the scholars another reason for using the present tense form taqtuloon which is to provide a sense of \n    continuity ie the jews kept on killing the prophets even the last of them muhammad  peace and blessings of allaah be upon him they \n    killed the prophet  peace and blessings of allaah be upon him with the poison that they gave him at khaybar and he  peace and \n    blessings of allaah be upon him continued to suffer the effects of that until in his final illness he said i still feel pain from the food i \n    ate at khaybar this is the time when it has cut off my aorta \nabu dawood also narrated by albukhaari in a \n    muallaq report alalbaani said in saheeh abi dawood 3784 it is hasan saheeh \nwith regard to the verse in which allaah says \n     \ninterpretation of the meaning\nwhen \n    he has decreed something he says to it only be __and \n    it is kun fa yakoon\naal imraan 347\nthis is more indicative of the ignorance of \n    this objector because this verse is speaking of when allaah wills to create something in the future not in the past this is to be understood \n    from the use of the word idha meaning when if which refers to something in the future hence the verb yaqool says appears in \n    the present tense to indicate that it is referring to something in the future and it is followed by the verb yakoon it is also in the \n    present tense which also refers to something in the future \nand allaah knows best"

to write anything other than the quran\nat first the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him forbade the writing of anything other than the quran and he forbade them to write down his words for a while so that the sahabah would focus on memorizing the quran and writing it down and so that the words of the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him would not be confused with the words of allah and so the quran was protected from anything being added or taken away \nthe prophetic order to write down the revelation\nthe prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him appointed a group of his companions who were trustworthy and knowledgeable to write down the revelation  they are known in their biographies as those who wrote down the revelation such as the four caliphs abdallah ibn amr ibn alas muawiyah ibn abi sufyan zayd ibn thabit and others  may allah be pleased with them all \nthe quran was revealed in seven dialects\nthe quran was revealed in seven dialects as was narrated in the saheeh hadeeth of umar ibn alkhattab may allah be pleased with him from the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him this was narrated by albukhari 2287 and muslim 818 these were the dialects of the arabs which were known for their eloquence \nhow was the quran compiled\nthe quran continued to be preserved in the hearts of the sahabah who had memorized it and on the skins and other materials until the time of the caliph abu bakr alsiddeeq may allah be pleased with him \nduring the riddah wars many of the sahabah who had memorized the quran were killed and abu bakr may allah be pleased with him was afraid that the quran would be lost so he consulted the senior sahabah about compiling the quran in a single book so that it would remain preserved and would not be lost he entrusted this mission to the chief of memorizers zayd ibn thabit may allah be pleased with him albukhari narrated in his saheeh 4986 that zayd ibn thabit may allah be pleased with him said  \nabu bakr alsiddeeq sent for me when the people of alyamamah had been killed ie a number of the prophets companions who fought against the false prophet musaylimah i went to him and found umar ibn alkhattab sitting with him abu bakr then said to me  umar has come to me and said casualties were heavy among the qurra of the quran ie those who knew the quran by heart on the day of the battle of alyamamah and i am afraid that more heavy casualties may take place among the qurra on other battlefields whereby a large part of the quran may be lost therefore i suggest that you abu bakr order that the quran be collected i said to umar how can you do something that the messenger of allah peace and blessings of allah be upon him did not do umar said by allah this is something good umar kept on urging me to accept his proposal till allah opened my heart to it and i began to realize the good in the idea which umar had realized then abu bakr said to me you are a wise young man and we do not have any suspicion about you and you used to write the divine inspiration for the messenger of allah peace and blessings of allah be upon him so search for the fragmentary scripts of the quran and compile it in one book by allah if they had ordered me to move one of the mountains it would not have been heavier for me than this ordering me to compile the quran then i said to abu bakr how can you do something that the messenger of allah peace and blessings of allah be upon him did not do abu bakr replied by allah it is a good thing abu bakr kept on urging me to accept his idea until allah opened my heart to that to which he had opened the hearts of abu bakr and umar so i started looking for the quran and collecting it from what it was written on palm stalks thin white stones and also from the men who knew it by heart until i found the last verse of surah altaubah with abu khuzaymah alansari and i did not find it with anybody other than him the verse is interpretation of the meaning  \nverily there has come unto you a messenger muhammad from amongst yourselves it grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty altaubah 9128 until the end of surat baraah ie altaubah  \nthen the complete manuscript copy of the quran remained with abu bakr until he died then with umar until the end of his life and then with hafsah the daughter of umar may allah be pleased with them \nthe sahabi zayd ibn thabit may allah be pleased with him knew the quran by heart but he was methodical in his confirmation he would not agree to write down any verse until two of the sahabah testified that they had heard it from the messenger of allah peace and blessings of allah be upon him  \nwhat was the quran copy of uthman\nthis mushaf written copy of the quran remained in the hands of the caliphs until the time of the rightlyguided caliph uthman ibn affan may allah be pleased with him the sahabah may allah be pleased with them had dispersed to different lands and they used to recite the quran according to what they had heard of the seven recitations from the messenger of allah peace and blessings of allah be upon him and each of their students used to recite according to what he had heard from his shaykh\nif a student heard someone reciting in a manner different from what he knew he would denounce him and accuse him of making a mistake and this went on until the sahabah feared that there would be fitnah trouble between the tabieen and successive generations so they thought that they should unite the people in following one recitation which was in the dialect of quraysh in which the quran had first been revealed so as to dispel any disputes and resolve the matter uthman may allah be pleased with him was consulted and he agreed with this opinion \nalbukhari narrated in his saheeh 4988 from anas ibn malik that hudhayfah ibn alyaman came to uthman at the time when the people of sham syria and the people of iraq were waging war to conquer armenia and azerbaijan hudhayfah was alarmed by their the people of sham and iraq differences in the recitation of the quran so he said to uthman o ameer almumineen save this nation before they dispute about the book quran as the jews and the christians did before so uthman sent a message to hafsah saying send us the manuscript of the quran so that we may make copies of the mushaf and we will return the manuscript to you  \nhafsah sent it to uthman then uthman ordered zayd ibn thabit abdullah ibn alzubayr saeed ibn alas and abd alrahman ibn harith ibn hisham to copy out the manuscripts uthman said to the three men who were from quraysh the tribe of which the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him was a member in case you disagree with zayd ibn thabit on any point in the quran then write it in the dialect of quraysh for the quran was revealed in their tongue they did so and when they had written many copies uthman returned the original manuscripts to hafsah  \nuthman sent to every muslim province one copy of what they had copied and ordered that all the other quranic materials whether written in fragmentary manuscripts or whole copies be burnt  \nibn shihab said kharijah ibn zayd ibn thabit told me that he heard zayd ibn thabit say when we made copies of the mushaf i missed a verse of alahzab that i used to hear the messenger of allah peace and blessings of allah be upon him recite so we searched for it and we found it with khuzaymah ibn taabit alansari the verse was among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with allah alahzab 3323  interpretation of the meaning so we put it in its place in its surah in the mushaf\nthus an end was put to dispute and the muslims were united the quran has remained and will remain narrated from generation to generation and preserved in mens hearts until the day of resurrection this is how allah has preserved his book in confirmation of the verse in which he says interpretation of the meaning\nverily we it is we who have sent down the dhikr ie the quran and surely we will guard it from corruption alhijr 159\n and allah knows best"

    "question": "refutation of those who try to prove that the quraan is not true",
    "answer": "praise be to allah\n    1  the proof that the copies of the holy quraan that we \n    have before us is not just one or two pieces of evidence rather it is \n    proven by a vast amount of evidence that no fairminded person can study \n    without becoming convinced that it is exactly as allaah revealed it to \n    muhammad  peace and blessings of allaah be upon him \n\n    2  there have been generations coming one after another \n    reciting the book of allaah and studying it memorizing it and writing it \n    down they have not omitted a single letter and no one can change even the \n    vowel point of a single letter writing is just one means of preserving it \n    basically it is preserved in their hearts \n\n    3  the quraan has not come down to us on its own such that \n    the socalled alterations could be made rather the interpretation of its \n    verses the meanings of its words the reasons for its revelation the \n    grammar of its words and the commentary on its rulings have all been \n    transmitted when such care has been given to this book how could sinful \n    hands find a way to distort even one letter of it or add a word or take \n    away a verse \n\n    4  the quraan speaks of matters of the unseen in the \n    future which allaah revealed to his messenger muhammad  peace and \n    blessings of allaah be upon him to show him that they came from allaah if \n    a human being wants to write a book he can describe an event or express a \n    point of view but if any human being were to speak about matters of the \n    unseen in this field he can only base that on speculation and lies but the \n    quraan told of the defeat of the romans by the persians at the time when \n    there was no means of communication to inform the arabs of this event the \n    same verses also foretold that they the persians would be defeated after a \n    certain number of years if what the quraan said was not accurate then the \n    kaafirs would have had a great opportunity to criticize the quraan \n\n    5  if you read any verse of the quraan then you go to \n    america or asia or the jungles of africa or to the deserts of arabia or any \n    place where there are muslims you will find that all of them have the exact \n    same verse memorized by heart or in their books not a single letter of it \n    will have been altered  \n\n    so what is the importance of this unknown manuscript in yemen \n    which we have not seen and in which some ignorant may have altered in \n    recent times one verse or one word \n\n    does this argument carry any weight when properly researched \n    and discussed especially when the people claim to be fairminded and \n    objective in their research  \n\n    what would be their response if we went to one of their most \n    trusted books by a wellknown author a book of which there are many copies \n    in the world all of them exactly the same and we claimed that there was a \n    copy of this book in some country or other in which there was extra material \n    and alterations and it was different from what is in their copies would \n    they pay any attention \n\n    their answer would be the same as ours \n\n    6  the manuscript copies which are in the muslims \n    possession cannot be proven to be authentic in this simplistic manner for \n    we have experts who know the history of calligraphy and we have principles \n    and guidelines through which we may determine whether a manuscript is \n    genuine such as the names and signatures of the people who heard it and \n    read it  \n\n    we do not think that these features are present in this \n    socalled copy of the quraan in yemen or in others \n\n    7  we are happy to conclude our answer with this true story \n    that happened in baghdad during the abbasid era when a jew wanted to find \n    out how true are the books attributed by their followers to god namely the \n    torah among the jews the gospel among the christians and the quraan among \n    the muslims \n\n    he went to the torah and added and took away a few minor \n    things that were not very obvious then he gave it to a scribe from among \n    the jews and asked him to make copies of it it did not take long before \n    these copies were placed in the synagogues of the jews and were in \n    circulation among their major scholars \n\n    then he went to the gospel and added and took away a few \n    things as he had done with the torah and he gave it to their scribes and \n    asked them to make copies of it it was not long before it was being read in \n    their churches and was in circulation among their scholars \n\n    then he went to the quraan and added and took away a few \n    things as he had done with the torah and the gospel then he gave it to a \n    muslim scribe to make copies of it \n\n    when he went back to get his copy the scribe threw it in his \n    face and told him that this was not the quraan of the muslims \n\n    from this experiment the man came to know that the quraan is \n    the true book of allaah and that all other books were the works of human \n    beings \n\n    if the scribes of the muslims could tell that this copy had \n    been tampered with then how could it go into circulation among the muslim \n    scholars undetected \n\n    if the questioner wants to repeat this ancient experiment \n    nowadays all she has to do is to do the same as that jewish man did who \n    later became muslim she can add and take away things from these three books \n    and see what happens as a result \n\n    but we do not tell her to show her copy of the quraan to a \n    scribe rather we tell her to show it to muslim children and they will tell \n    her where the mistakes are in her copy \n\n    some muslim states have printed mushafs in which there were \n    mistakes and young children found them before the grownups did\n\n     and allaah is the guide to the straight path"

    "question": "claims that the quraan has been distorted",
    "answer": "praise be to allahfirstly \nit is not possible for a muslim to entertain doubts concerning the immutability of the quraan because allaah has guaranteed to preserve the quraan allaah says interpretation of the meaning \nverily we it is we who have sent down the dhikr ie the quraan and surely we will guard it from corruption\nalhijr 159\nthe quraan was preserved in the hearts of the sahaabah who had memorized it and on the trunks of trees and thin white stones until the time of the caliph abu bakr alsiddeeq may allaah be pleased with him during the riddah wars many of the sahaabah who had memorized the quraan were killed so abu bakr may allaah be pleased with him was afraid that the quraan may be lost he consulted the senior sahaabah concerning the idea of compiling the entire quraan in one book so that it would be preserved and would not be lost and this task was entrusted to the great hafiz zayd ibn thaabit and others who had written down the revelation albukhaari narrated in his saheeh that zayd ibn thaabit may allaah be pleased with him said  \nabu bakr assiddeeq sent for me when the people of yamamah had been killed ie a number of the prophets companions who fought against musaylimah i went to him and found umar bin alkhattaab sitting with him abu bakr may allaah be pleased with him said to me  umar has come to me and said casualties were heavy among the qurra of the quraan ie those who knew the quraan by heart at the battle of yamaamah and i am afraid that more heavy casualties may take place among the qurra on other battlefields whereby a large part of the quran may be lost therefore i suggest that you abu bakr should issue orders that the quraan be collected i said to umar how can you do something that the messenger of allaah peace and blessings of allaah be upon him did not do umar said by allah this is something good umar kept on urging me to accept his proposal until allah opened my heart to it and i began to realize the good in the idea which umar had realized then abu bakr said to me you are a wise young man and we have a great deal of confidence in you you used to write down the revelation for the messenger of allaah peace and blessings of allaah be upon him so you should seek out the quraan ie the fragments on which it is written and collect it in one book by allaah if they had ordered me to move one of the mountains it would not have been harder for me than this command to collect the quraan i said to abu bakr how can you do something which the messenger of allaah peace and blessings of allaah be upon him did not do abu bakr said by allaah it is a good thing abu bakr kept on urging me to accept his proposal until allah opened my heart to it as he had opened the hearts of abu bakr and umar so i started to look for the quraan and collected it from the fragments on which it was written of palmstalks thin white stones and the hearts of men ie from men who knew it by heart until i found the last verse of soorat altawbah with abu khuzaymah alansaari and i did not find it with anybody other than him the verse is   \nverily there has come unto you a messenger from amongst yourselves it grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty\naltawbah 9128  interpretation of the meaning\n until the end of soorat baraaah soorat altawbah \nthese fragments remained with abu bakr until he died then with umar for the rest of his life then with hafsah bint umar may allaah be pleased with them both \nsecondly \nwith regard to alhajjaaj it was not his idea to write out the mushaf rather he was commanded by an intelligent man to do that there follows the complete story \nalzarqaani said \nit is known that the mushaf of uthmaan was unpointed ie it had no diacritical marks whatever the case the addition of diacritical marks to the mushaf did not happen according to the wellestablished view until the era of abd almalik ibn marwaan when he realized that islam had spread widely and the arabs were mixing with the nonarabs which was having an effect on the arabic language so that there was much confusion about the correct reading of the mushafs and it was becoming very difficult for people to tell the letters apart by his deep insight he realized that he should do something to solve the problem so he commanded alhajjaaj to take care of this important matter in obedience to the caliph alhajjaaj appointed two men to deal with this matter namely nasr ibn aasim allaythi and yahya ibn yamar aladwaani both of whom were qualified and able to do the task required of them because they were knowledgeable righteous pious and experts in arabic language and the various readings of the quraan they had also both studied under abulaswad alduli may allaah have mercy on these two shaykhs for they succeeded in their work and gave the mushaf diacritical points for the first time they added dots to all the letters that look similar not adding more than three dots to any one letter that became widespread among the people and was very effective in dispelling confusion concerning reading of the mushaf  \nit was said that the first person to add diacritical marks to the mushaf was abulaswad alduli and that ibn seereen had a mushaf to which diacritical marks had been added by yahya ibn yamar these opinions may be reconciled by noting that abulaswad was the first one who added diacritical marks to the mushaf but he did that for his own individual use then ibn seereen followed him in that and that abd almalik was the first one to add diacritical marks to the mushaf  in an official and public manner that was spread widely among the people in order to dispel any confusion with regard to reading quraan \nmanaahil alirfaan 1280 281 \nthirdly \nwith regard to what is mentioned in the question quoting from almasaahif by ibn abi dawood there follows the report concerning that and the ruling thereon \nit was narrated from abbaad ibn suhayb from awf ibn abi jameelah that alhajjaaj ibn yoosuf changed eleven letters in the mushaf he said that in soorat albaqarah 2259 it said lam yatasanna wanzur with no ha and he changed it to lam yatasannah wanzur they show no change and look \nin almaaidah 548 it said shareeatan wa minhaajan and he changed it to shiratan wa minhaajan a law and a clear way \nin yoonus 1022 it said huwa alladhi yunshirukum and he changed it to huwa alladhi yusayyirukum he it is who enables you to travel \nin yoosuf 1245 it said ana aateekum bi taweelihi and he changed it to ana unabbiukum bi taweelihi i will tell you its interpretation \nin alzukhruf 4332 it said nahnu qasamnaa baynahum maaayishahum and he changed it to nahnu qasamnaa baynahum maeeshatahum it is we who portion out between them their livelihood \nin altakweer 8124 it said wa ma huwa alalghaybi bi zaneen and he changed it to wa ma huwa alalghaybi bi daneen and he withholds not a knowledge of the unseen \nkitaab almasaahif by alsajistaani p 49 \nthis report is daeef jiddan very weak or mawdoo fabricated because its isnaad includes abbaad ibn suhayb whose hadeeth is to be rejected \nali ibn almadeeni said his hadeeth is no good albukhaari alnasaai and others said he is matrook to be rejected ibn hibbaan said he was a qadari who promoted his innovated ideas and he narrated things which a beginner in this field would realize were fabricated if he heard them aldhahabi said he is one of those who are to be rejected \nsee meezaan alitidaal by aldhahabi 428 \nthe text of the report is also false because it dos not make sense that these changes could be made in the quraan and then spread throughout the world even some of the nonmuslims such as the raafidis shiah who think that the quraan is incomplete rejected this and criticized its text \nalkhoi who is one of the raafidis said this claim is like the hallucination of one who is suffering a fever or like the fairy tales of the insane or of children alhajjaaj was one of the governors of the umayyads and he is too incapable to do anything to the quraan he is even incapable of changing any of the minor issues of islam so how could he change the thing which is the foundation of the religion and the basis of shareeah where would he get the power to introduce this change throughout the realm of islam and beyond at the time when the quraan was well known throughout the muslim world how come no historian has ever mentioned this disastrous event even though it is so serious and they would have a lot of motives to mention it how come no one among the muslims of his time narrated it how could the muslims have turned a blind eye to such an action after the reign of alhajjaaj came to an end even if we assume that he could have gathered all the copies of the quraan and that not one single copy escaped his grasp anywhere in the farflung regions of the islamic world how could he have removed it from the hearts of the muslims and those who had memorized it the number of whom at that time is known only to allaah \nalbayaan fi tafseer alquraan p 219 \nwhat the questioner mentions about imam alsajistaani and that he wrote a book called ma ghayyarahu alhajjaaj fi mushaf uthmaan what alhajjaaj altered in the mushaf of uthmaan is not true rather it is a blatant lie all there is is the commentary that alsajistaani wrote concerning the words quoted above from alhajjaaj entitled baab ma kataba alhajjaaj ibn yoosuf filmushaf chapter on what alhajjaaj wrote in the mushaf \non this basis we cannot rely upon this report under any circumstances whatsoever the fact that until now it has not been proven that anyone has succeeded in his attempt to change even one letter of the quraan is sufficient to prove that it is a lie if what has been narrated is true then it would be possible to repeat it especially at the times when the muslims were weak and their enemies plotted against them  it is such specious arguments that prove that these claims are false and that our enemies are incapable of refuting the evidence of the quraan or its clarity so they resorted to attacking it \nand allaah knows best"

mother of his son ismaaeel he said \nibraaheem brought her and her son ismaaeel while \n          she was suckling him to a place near the kabah under a tree on the \n          spot of zamzam at the highest place in the mosque during those days \n          there was nobody in makkah nor was there any water so he made them \n          sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing

they \n          could not see him he faced the kabah and raising both hands prayed \n          to allaah in the following words\no \n          our lord i have made some of my offspring to dwell in an

and \n          drinking from the water she had when the water in the waterskin \n          had all been used up she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty \n          she started looking at him ie ismaaeel tossing in agony or he \n          said kicking with his heels she left him for she could not endure \n          looking at him and found that the mountain of alsafa was the nearest \n          mountain to her on that land she stood on it and started looking at \n          the valley keenly so that she might see somebody but she could not \n          see anybody then she descended from alsafa and when she reached the \n          valley she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in \n          distress and trouble till she crossed the valley and reached almarwa \n          where she stood and started looking expecting to see somebody but \n          she could not see anybody she repeated that running between alsafa \n          and almarwa seven times\nibn abbaas said the prophet  \n          peace and blessings of allaah be upon him said this is the \n          source of the tradition of the walking between them ie alsafa and \n          almarwa when

flowed from that place she started to make \n          something like a basin around it using her hand in this way and started \n          filling her waterskin with water with her hands and the water started \n          flowing out after she had scooped some of it\nibn \n          abbaas said the prophet  \n          peace and blessings of allaah be upon him added may allah bestow mercy on

been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth \n          the prophet further added then she drank water and suckled \n          her child the angel said to her dont be afraid of being neglected \n          for this is the house of allah which will be built by this boy and his \n          father and allah never neglects his people the house ie kabah \n          at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock and when torrents \n          came they flowed to its right and left she lived in that way till \n          some people from the tribe of jurhum or a family from jurhum passed \n          by her and her child as they ie the jurhum people were coming through \n          the way of kada they landed in the lower part of makkah where they \n          saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving \n          it they said this bird must be flying around water though we know \n          that there is no water in this valley they sent one or two messengers \n          who discovered the source of water and returned to inform them of the \n          water so they all came towards the water\nthe \n          prophet  \n          peace and blessings of allaah be upon him added \n          ismaaeels mother was sitting near the water they asked her \n          do you allow us to stay with you she replied yes but you will \n          have no right to possess the water they agreed to that ibn \n          abbaas said the prophet  \n          peace and blessings of allaah be upon him further said ismaaeels mother was pleased with \n          the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the \n          people so they settled there and later on they sent for their families \n          who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent \n          residents there the child ie ismaaeel grew up and learnt arabic \n          from them and his virtues caused them to love and admire him as he \n          grew up and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry \n          a woman from amongst them  \nafter ismaaeels mother had died ibraaheem \n          came after ismaaeels marriage in order to see his family that he had \n          left before\nthen \n          ibraaheem came back later on he saw ismaaeel under a tree near zamzam \n          sharpening his arrows when he saw ibraaheem he stood up to welcome \n          him and they greeted each other as a father does with his son and a \n          son does with his father ibraaheem said o ismaaeel allah has given \n          me an order ismaaeel said do what your lord has ordered you to \n          do ibraaheem asked will you help me ismaaeel said i will help \n          you ibraaheem said allah has ordered me to build a house here \n          pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it the \n          prophet added then they raised the foundations of the house ie \n          the kabah ismaaeel brought the stones and ibraaheem was building \n          and when the walls became high ismaaeel brought this stone and put \n          it for ibraaheem who stood on it and carried on building while ismaaeel

    "answer": "praise be to allah and peace and blessings be upon the messenger of allaah\n celebrating the completion of memorizing the quraan is not sunnah because nothing of that nature was narrated from the prophet peace and blessings of allaah be upon him or from any of his sahaabah doing this on the grounds that it is part of religion is bidah but people do it as a customary expression of joy for the blessing of having memorized quraan like celebrations for the return of one who has been away or for finding work or for moving to a new home if the celebration for completing the quraan is of this nature then there is nothing wrong with it if a passage from the quraan is recited from the beginning or the end without having to recite a specific soorah or recite in a particular way such as joining the end to the beginning then this is fine because reciting from quraan is the best thing that can be done in a gathering and it is a reminder for those who are present with regard to making duaa when completing the recitation of the quraan it was reported with a saheeh isnaad from anas may allaah be pleased with him that when he completed the quraan he would gather his family together and make duaa with them if the reader makes duaa when he completes the quraan and those who are present say ameen to his duaa this is fine\n with regard to calling the teacher shaykhah  there is nothing wrong with this now you know may allaah bless you that there is no reason not to have the celebration you have described there is no need to read from the end of the mushaf and then join it to the beginning doing something in this manner requires evidence daleel because reading quraan is an act of worship and acts of worship must be done only in the manner in which the prophet peace and blessings of allaah be upon him did them as allaah says interpretation of the meaning\nindeed in the messenger of allaah muhammad you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for the meeting with allaah and the last day and remembers allaah much alahzaab 3321\n written by shaykh abdalrahmaan albarraak\n there is a hadeeth about the person who stops for a rest immediately carrying on which was narrated by altirmidhi may allaah have mercy on him from ibn abbaas according to this hadeeth a man said o messenger of allaah which deed is most beloved to allaah he said alhaal almurtahil the man said what is alhaal almurtahil he said the one who starts from the beginning of the quraan until he reaches the end and when he stops for a rest he immediately carries on\n but this hadeeth is daeef weak as altirmidhi may allaah have mercy on him says after he quotes it this is a ghareeb strange hadeeth which we only know from ibn abbaas with this isnaad and this isnaad is not strong\n hence ibn alqayyim may allaah have mercy on him said in alilaam p289 part2 after he mentioned this hadeeth some of them understood from this that when a person has finished reading the whole quraan he should then read alfaatihah and three verses of soorat albaqarah because he stopped when he completed it and he continued when he started again but none of the sahaabah or taabieen did this and none of the imaams regarded it as mustahabb encouraged what is referred to in the hadeeth is when a person returns from one military campaign and immediately joins another or every time he completes one good deed he starts another which he  completes as he did the first one but what some readers do is not what was meant in the hadeeth at all and allaah is the source of strength"

    "question": "is it true that there is no evidence of a quraan being written\r\n      in the 7th century",
    "answer": "praise be to allahthis is a false and incorrectstatement made by those who try to find faults with\n      islam so as to put people off this religion it is sufficient to know that\n      allaah has guaranteed to preserve the quraan as he says\n      interpretation of the meaning\nverily\n      we it is we who have sent down the dhikr ie the quraan and surely\n      we will guard it from corruption alhijr 159\n moreover the fact that the transmission\n      of the quraan by memory and in writing was mutawaatir  narrated by\n      groups to groups to such anextent\n      that so many people could not conceivably have agreed upon a lie  is\n      well known to anyone who has the slightest acquaintance with islamic\n      knowledge especially knowledge of recitations and reciters \n there are still many people nowadays who\n      have learned the quraan orally with isnaads directly going back to the\n      prophet \n peace and blessings of allaah be upon him\n one of the miracles of allaahs\n      protection of the quraan is the fact that those who try to tamper with\n      it are always found out\n the point is everything that was\n      revealed to the prophet \n peace and blessings of allaah be upon him\n      was written down in front of him straight away and some of the sahaabah\n      had masaahif written copies\n      of the quraan after the death of the prophet \n peace and\n      blessings of allaah be upon him thefirst khaleefah abu bakr alsiddeeq may allaah be pleased with\n      him gathered the quraan inwritten\n      and kept it then the third khaleefah uthmaan ibn affaan may\n      allaah be pleased with him compiled it in mushafs that were based on the\n      mushaf compiled by abu bakr in addition to what had been memorized\nwhen\n      we realize that the quraan was written down and compiled by the\n      sahaabah and uthmaan sent copies of the mushaf during his reign to\n      all the main centres of islam so that it would be a reference for them\n      and there were no disputes concerning them then how can we say that there\n      is no written trace of the quraan in the seventh century moreover\n      there are several ancient manuscripts of the quraan in libraries and\n      museums which bear visible testimony to the fact that nothing has been\n      changed in the book of allaah allaah says interpretation of the\n      meaning\nand\n      verily it is an honourable wellfortified respected book because\n      it is allaahs speech and he has protected it from corruption\n      falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it it is sent down\n      by the allwise worthy of all\n      praise allaah fussilat 414142\n      \n      \n      \n      and allaah knows best"

    "question": "do you have to recite surahs in order in prayer",
    "answer": "praise be to allahtypes of tankis\nreading later parts of the quran before earlier parts is called tankis inversion there are different types of tankis\n        tankis alhuruf inversion of letters\n        tankis alkalimat inversion of words\n        tankis alayat inversion of verses\n        tankis alsuwar inversion of surahs\nwhat is tankis alhuruf inversion of letters\ntankis alhuruf inversion of letters means putting a later letter before a previous letter in one word for example instead of rabb one reads barr\nundoubtedly this is haram and invalidates a persons prayer because it changes the quran from the way in which it was spoken by allah and usually alters the meaning in a drastic manner alsharh almumti by ibn uthaymin 3110\nwhat is tankis alkalimat inversion of words\ntankis alkalimat inversion of words means putting a later word before a previous word for example instead of qul huwa allahu ahad one reads ahad allah huwa qul\nthis also is undoubtedly haram because it changes the quran from the way in which it was spoken by allah alsharh almumti 3110\nwhat is tankis alayat inversion of verses\ntankis alaayat inversion of verses means reciting a later ayah before a previous ayah for example reciting min sharr ilwaswas ilkhannas before ilah ilnas\nconcerning this alqadi iyad may allah have mercy on him said\nthere is no dispute concerning the order of the verses in each surah this is something which is tawqifi ie based on revelation and is not open to ijtihad and the order is that which now appears in the mushaf and this is how the ummah transmitted it from the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him sharh alnawawi 662 this was also the view of ibn alarabi as stated in alfath 2257\nshaykh ibn uthaymin said\ntankis alayat inverting verses is also haram according to the most correct view because the order of the verses is tawqifi something which is based on revelation and not open to ijtihad the meaning of tawqifi is that it was dictated by the order of the messenger peace and blessings of allah be upon him alsharh almumti 3110\nwhat is tankis alsuwar inversion of surahs\ntankis alsuwar inversion of surahs means reciting later surahs before earlier ones for example reciting al imran before albaqarah\nruling on tankis alsuwar\nthose scholars who say that the order of surahs is not tawqifi do not see anything wrong with this\nthose who think that it is tawqifi or that the consensus of the companions on the order of surahs is evidence do not think that it is permissible\nthe correct view is that the order of surahs is not tawqifi it is the result of ijtihad on the part of some of the companions\nthere was no ijma consensus among the companions on the order of surahs the order in the mushaf of abdallah ibn masud for example is different from that in the mushafs of others\nin the sunnah there is evidence that supports the view that it is permissible\nhudhayfah said i prayed with the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him one night and he started to recite albaqarah i thought he would do ruku when he reached one hundred ayas but he kept going i thought he would complete it in one rakah but he kept going i thought he would do ruku now but he started to recite alnisa and he recited all of it then he started to recite al imran and recited all of it narrated by muslim 772\nthe evidence in this hadith is that he recited alnisa then al imran\nalnawawi said\nalqadi iyad said this contains evidence for those who say that the order of surahs is the result of ijtihad on the part of the muslims when they wrote down the mushaf the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him did not dictate the order of surahs he entrusted this task to his ummah after his death this is the view of malik and the majority of the scholars and was the view favoured by alqadi abu bakr albaqillani ibn albaqillani said it is the more correct of the two views although both are possible\nhe said what we say is that the order of surahs is not binding when writing praying studying teaching or learning there is no report from the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him concerning that which would make it forbidden to differ from it hence the order of surahs in the various mushafs differed before the mushaf of uthman\nthe prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him and the ummah after him in all ages regarded it as permissible to differ from the order of surahs in prayer  and when studying and teaching\nhe said with regard to the view of those scholars who say that the order of surahs was set by the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him and that he put them in the same order as appears in the mushaf of uthman and that the different orders came about before they heard of his ruling and his final review of the quran with jibril they interpret the fact that he peace and blessings of allah be upon him recited alnisa first and then al imran as meaning that this happened before the final ruling was dictated and these two surahs appear in this order in the mushaf of ubayy\nhe said there is no dispute concerning the fact that a person who is praying may recite in the second rakah a surah which comes before the surah which he recited in the first rakah but it is makruh to do this in one rakah or when reciting quran outside of prayer\nhe said but some of them permitted this\nthe prohibition of the salaf against reading the quran backwards is interpreted as referring to those who read from the end of a surah to the beginning\nhe said there is no dispute concerning the fact that the order of verses in each surah is based on revelation from allah and is as it now appears in the mushaf and as it was transmitted by the ummah from the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him end of the comments of alqadi iyad and allah knows best sharh muslim 661 62\nalsindi said\nthe phrase in the hadith of hudhayfah then he started to recite al imran means that it is not obligatory to follow the order of surahs when reciting sharh alnasai 3226\n        it was reported from anas ibn malik may allah be pleased with him that a man from among the ansar used to lead them in prayer in the mosque of quba every time he led them in prayer he would start his recitation with qul huwa allahu ahad then when he finished it he would recite another surah he did that in every rakah his companions spoke with him and said you always start with this surah then you do not think it is enough and you recite another either you should recite this surah alone or you should leave it and recite another he said i am not going to stop reciting it if you like i will lead you in prayer as i have been doing and if you do not like it i will leave you they felt that he was one of the best of them and they did not want anyone else to lead them in prayer when the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him came to them they told him about this he said o so and so what is stopping you from doing what your companions tell you what makes you keep on reciting this surah in every rakah he said i love it he said your love for it will grant you admittance to paradise narrated by albukhari muallaqan and by altirmidhi with an isnad similar to that of albukhari 2901\nthe evidence in this report is the fact that the man recited surat alikhlas in his prayer before any other surah that comes before it in the mushaf and the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him approved of that\n        this is the action of umar may allah be pleased with him\nalimam albukhari said\nalahnaf recited alkahf in the first rakah and yusuf or yunus in the second and he said that he had prayed fajr with umar and he had done the same bab aljam bayna suratayn filrakah in kitab aladhan\nwith regard to the latter part of your question we say\nit is permissible to recite verses 5060 of albaqarah in the first rakah then to recite verses 120 of albaqarah in the second rakah because then the meaning of the passage will be complete\nbut reciting verses 1020 means that one is cutting off the meaning so it is better not to do this perhaps you mentioned the numbers only by way of example and you did not mean these particular verses\nfor more please see these answers 20043  69915  171060  and 7198 \nand allah knows best"

    "question": "hanging quranic verses on walls",
    "answer": "praise be to allahhanging plaques and cloths containing verses of the quran in homes  schools social clubs and places of business involves a number of reservations and prohibitions according to islam such as the following\n\nin most cases hanging such things on the wall is done for purposes of decoration and adornment as the verses etc are written in calligraphy and colorful brocade this is an inappropriate use of the quran as it was revealed to guide people and to be read regularly the quran was not revealed to decorate walls but to guide mankind\nsome people hang up such things for blessing  which is a form of worship the blessing as described in islam comes from reading or reciting the quran not from hanging it up or placing it on shelves or turning it into artwork and threedimensional images\nthis is contrary to the practice of the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him and the rightlyguided khalifas alkhulafa alrashidun may allah be pleased with them who never did such a thing the best way is to follow them not to introduce innovations in religion history tells us that in places such as andalusia turkey etc the adornment of houses and mosques with ornate carvings of verses only happened at times when the muslims were weak and humiliated\nhanging up such pictures or plaques could lead to shirk because some people think that these things are amulets that will protect the house and its people from evil and disease this is shirk and is haram because the one who really offers protection is allah may he be glorified and one of the means of gaining his protection is sincere recitation of the quran and duas taught in the quran and sunnah\nthere is the risk that the quran may be used in such cases as a means of promoting ones business or increasing ones earnings the quran should be protected from being used for such purposes it is wellknown that the production and sale of these pictures and plaques involves a great deal of extravagance and wasting money\nmany of these plaques are painted with real gold which makes using them and hanging them up even more haram\nmany of these plaques involve a kind of carelessness because the letters are twisted into complex designs that are of no benefit to anyone because they are barely legible sometimes words are fashioned into the shape of a bird or a man prostrating and similarly forbidden pictures of animate beings\nverses and surahs of the quran are exposed to misuse and abuse by this practice for example when moving house they are piled up with the rest of the furniture and belongings and other objects may be placed on top of them this also happens when they are taken down so that the wall may be painted or cleaned\nsome muslims whose observance of islam is lacking put these plaques and pictures up so that they can feel that they are doing something religious in order to reduce their feelings of guilt in spite of the fact that this practice does not help them in any way\n\nall in all we must close the doors of evil and follow the leaders of guidance of the early centuries of islam whose people the prophet peace and blessings be upon him testified were the best of the muslims in faith and practice if someone were to say we are not going to abuse it or make it a decoration or exaggerate about it we only want to remind people about their religion in our gatherings our response would be if we look at real life will we find that this is what actually happens do people really remember allah do they even read these verses when they raise their heads\nwhat really happens is the opposite people go against the words hanging over their heads they still tell lies engage in gossip make fun of others and do and say evil things even if we assume that there are some who do benefit from these plaques etc the fact is that they are very few and this does not change the islamic ruling on the matter\nthe muslims must turn to the book of allah read it and recite it and act in accordance with it we ask allah to make the quran a light of guidance for us and a means of removing our grief and anxiety may allah bless our prophet muhammad\nfor more please see these answers 39185  13648 and 170060 \nand allah knows best"

    "question": "which is better    to recite quran from the mushaf or from memory",
    "answer": "praise be to allahif one is reciting quran in situations other than in prayer then reading from the mushaf is better because it is more accurate and helps one to remember better but if reciting from memory is easier and helps one to concentrate more and have better presence of mind khushoo then one should recite from memory\nin prayer however it is better to recite from memory because if a person recites from the mushaf he will be doing repeated actions such as holding the mushaf putting it down turning its pages and looking at the letters by doing so he will miss out on putting his right hand over his left hand on his chest when standing during the prayer or spreading out his arms during rukoo and sujood if he puts the mushaf under his arm hence we think that it is preferable for a person who is praying to recite from memory rather than from the mushaf\nwe see some people when they pray behind the imaam carrying the mushaf and following the imaams recitation this is something which should not be done for the reasons we have referred to above and because they do not need to do anything except follow the imaam\nhowever if the imaam does not have such a good memory and he says to one of the members of the congregation pray behind me and follow me my recitation in the mushaf and if i make a mistake correct me then there is nothing wrong with this"

    "question": "how was the order of the quran determined",
    "answer": "praise be to allahorder of verses in one surah\nthe fact there is scholarly consensus and many texts stating the order of verses in one surah that is very well known the consensus was reported by many scholars including alzarkashi in alburhan and abu jafar who said the order of the verses in their surahs came about because this is how it was instituted by the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him and there is no dispute among the muslims with regard to this matter\nthe texts regarding this matter include the following\n\nthe report narrated by ahmad abu dawud altirmidhi alnasai ibn hibban and alhakim from ibn abbas who said i said to uthman what made you put alanfal which is one of the mathani next to baraah altawbah which is one of the miin why did you not put the line bismillah irrahman irrahim in between them when you put it at the beginning of the rest of alsab altiwal the long seven surahs uthman said the messenger of allah peace and blessings of allah be upon him used to receive revelation of surahs with many verses when they were revealed he would call his scribes and tell them put these verses in the surah where suchandsuch is mentioned alanfal was one of the first surahs to be revealed in madinah and baraah altawbah was one of the last parts of the quran to be revealed its stories were similar to the stories mentioned in alanfal so it was thought that it was part of it the messenger of allah peace and blessings of allah be upon him was taken ie died without explaining whether it was indeed part of it so they were put next to one another and the line bismillahir rahman irrahim was not written between them and it altawbah was put among the sab altiwal seven long surahs alhakim said its isnad is sahih and aldhahabi agreed with him almustadrak 2330\nahmad narrated in almusnad 4218 with a hasan isnad from uthman ibn abilas that he said i was sitting with the messenger of allah peace and blessings of allah be upon him when he fixed his gaze on something then lowered his gaze until he was almost looking at the ground then he gazed at something he said jibril peace be upon him came to me and told me to put this verse in this place in this surah verily allâh enjoins aladl ie justice and worshipping none but allâh alone islâmic monotheism and alihsân ie to be patient in performing your duties to allâh totally for allâhs sake and in accordance with the sunnah legal ways of the prophet in a perfect manner and giving help to kith and kin ie all that allâh has ordered you to give them eg wealth visiting looking after them or any other kind of help and forbids alfahshâ ie all evil deeds eg illegal sexual acts disobedience of parents polytheism to tell lies to give false witness to kill a life without right and almunkar ie all that is prohibited by islâmic law polytheism of every kind disbelief and every kind of evil deeds and albaghy ie all kinds of oppression he admonishes you that you may take heed alnahl 1690  interpretation of the meaning\nalbukhari narrated in alsahih no 4536 that ibn abi malikah said ibn alzubayr said i said to uthman this verse that is in albaqarah interpretation of the meaning and those of you who die and leave wives behind them  and those of you who die and leave behind wives should bequeath for their wives a years maintenance and residence without turning them out albaqarah 2234240 has been abrogated by the other so why are you writing it down he said leave it as it is my nephew i will not change anything from its place\nmuslim narrated no 1617 that umar said i did not ask the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him about anything more than i asked him about alkalalah those who die leaving neither ascendants nor descendents as heirs until he poked me in the chest with his finger and said is not ayat alsayf at the end of surat alnisa enough for you\nthere are also the hadiths about the verses at the end of surat albaqarah\nmuslim narrated no 809 from abu aldarda that whoever memorizes the first ten verses of surat alkahf will be protected from the dajjal according to another version whoever recites the last ten verses will be protected\n\nthe prophets recitation of various surahs in the presence of his companions indicates that the order of their verses is something that was instituted and commanded by him and that the companions did not put the verses in a different order from that in which the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him used to recite them the reports to that effect reach the level of mutawatir\nalqadi abu bakr said in alintisar \nthe order of the verses is something that is obligatory and binding jibril used to say to the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him put such and such an verse in such and such a place\nhe also said\n what we think is that all of the quran which allah revealed and commanded that it should be written down and which was not abrogated after being revealed is that which is contained between the covers of the mushaf of uthman and that there is nothing lacking or added to it its order is the same as that commanded by allah may he be exalted and instituted by the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him nobody has moved any verse backwards or forwards the ummah learned from the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him the order of the verses of each surah properly just as they learned from him the correct pronunciation and recitation\nalbaghawi said in sharh alsunnah \nthe messenger of allah peace and blessings of allah be upon him used to instruct his companions and teach them what was revealed to him of the quran in the order in which it appears in our mushafs now the order which jibril taught him when each verse was revealed jibril would tell him this verse is to be written after such and such a verse in surah such and such thus it is clear that the efforts of the companions were limited solely to gathering the quran in one place not to arranging its order the quran is written on allawh almahfuz in this order then allah sent it down in its entirety to the first heaven whence it was revealed in stages as it was needed and the order in which it was revealed is not the order in which it is recited\norder of surahs in the quran\nwith regard to the order of surahs was this also instituted by the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him or was this the ijtihad of the companions with regard to this question there were differences among the scholars the majority of scholars including malik and alqadi abu bakr according to one of his two opinions favoured the second opinion\nibn faris said \nthere were two aspects to the compilation of the quran one was putting the surahs in a certain order such as putting alsab altiwal the seven long surahs first and following them with the miin which is what the companions did the second aspect is the compilation of the verses within the surahs this was instituted by the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him who recited them as he was told to by jibreel on the command of his lord on this basis the salaf differed as to the order in which the surahs should appear some of them put them in order of revelation which was the mushaf of ali which started with iqra alalaq then almuddaththir then nun alqalam then almuzzammil and so on the mushaf of ibn masud started with albaqarah then alnisa then al imran with other major differences the mushaf of ubayy was similar\nalkarmani said in alburhan the order of the surahs as it is now is the same as that in allawh almahfuz which is with allah this is the order in which the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him used to review the surahs of the quran he had received so far with jibril each year in the year in which he died he reviewed it with him twice and the last verses to be revealed were interpretation of the meaning and be afraid of the day when you shall be brought back to allah albaqarah 2281 jibril commanded the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him to put this between the verses dealing with riba and those dealing with loans\nalzarkashi said in alburhan the difference between the two views is one of wording those who support the second view say that it was taught to them so that they could learn the reasons of revelation and the sequence of the words hence malik said that they compiled the quran according to what they had heard from the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him as well as saying that the order of the surahs was the product of their ijtihad he said that the dispute boils down to one question which is was this a verbal instruction of the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him or were they merely referring to what he used to do which would give them room for ijtihad\nalbayhaqi said in almadkhil at the time of the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him the surahs and verses of the quran were in this order except for alanfal and baraah altawbah as we see from the hadith of uthman referred to above\nibn atiyah said the order of many of the surahs was known during the lifetime of the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him such as the seven long surahs those that begin with hamim and almufassal with regard to the others it may be the case that it was left for the ummah to determine their order after he died\nabu jafar said the reports support most of what ibn atiyah said and a little is left which is open to debate such as the hadith recite the two shining ones albaqarah and al imran reported by muslim no 804\nalbukhari narrated no 4739 that abdallah ibn masud may allah be pleased with him said bani israil alisra alkahf maryam taha and alanbiya these are among the earliest and most beautiful surahs and they are my treasures meaning these are among the earliest i recited\nabu jafar alnahhas almukhtar said that the surahs were compiled in this order from the messenger of allah peace and blessings of allah be upon him because of the hadith of wathilah in place of the tawrat i was given the seven long surahs he said this hadith indicates that the order of the quran was taken from the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him\nibn hajar said the fact that the surahs or most of them are in a given order does not contradict the idea that this was instituted by the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him what proves that this was instituted by the prophet peace and blessings of allah be upon him is the report narrated by ahmad and abu dawud from aws ibn hudhayfah who said we asked the companions of the messenger of allah peace and blessings of allah be upon him in the morning how did you write down the quran in chapters they said we wrote it down in chapters of six surahs five surahs seven surahs nine surahs eleven surahs and thirteen surahs and the chapter of almufassal from qaf until the end this indicates that the order of the surahs  as it appears in the mushaf now  existed at the time of the messenger of allah or it is possible that what was known in order at that time was hizb almufassal specifically which is not the case with the rest\nsee alitqan fi ulum alquran by alsuyuti 16265\nand allah knows best"

    "question": "verses of sujud altilawah in the quran",
    "answer": "praise be to allahsujud in the quran\nthere are fifteen places in the quran where we should perform sajdat altilawah prostration of recitation when reciting them \namr ibn alas narrated that the messenger of allah peace and blessings of allah be upon him recited to him fifteen verses in the quran where one should prostrate three of which are in almufassal and two in surat alhajj it was reported by abu dawud ibn majah alhakim and aldaraqutni and classed as hasan by almundhiri and alnawawi \nverses of sujud altilawah\nthe fifteen verses of sujud altilawah are\n\nsurely those who are with your lord angels are never too proud to perform acts of worship to him but they glorify his praise and prostrate before him alaraf 7206\nand unto allah alone falls in prostration whoever is in the heavens and the earth willingly or unwillingly and so do their shadows in the mornings and in the afternoons alrad 1315\nand to allah prostrate all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth of the live moving creatures and the angels and they are not proud ie they worship their lord allah with humility alnahl 1649\nsay o muhammad believe in it the quran or do not believe in it verily those who were given knowledge before it when it is recited to them fall down on their faces in humble prostration alisra 17107109\nwhen the verses of the most beneficent allah were recited unto them they fell down prostrating and weeping maryam 1958\nsee you not that to allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth and the sun and the moon and the stars and the mountains and the trees and aldawab moving living creatures beasts etc and many of mankind but there are many men on whom the punishment is justified and whomsoever allah disgraces none can honour him verily allah does what he wills alhajj 2218\no you who believe bow down and prostrate yourselves and worship your lord and do good that you may be successful alhajj 2277\nand when it is said to them prostrate to the most beneficent allah they say and what is the most beneficent shall we fall down in prostration to that which you o muhammad command us and it increases in them only aversion alfurqan 2560\nas shaytan has barred them from allahs way so that they do not worship prostrate before allah who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth and knows what you conceal and what you reveal alnaml 2725 26\nonly those believe in our ayat verses signs etc who when they are reminded of them fall down prostrate and glorify the praises of their lord and they are not proud alsajdah 3215\nand dawud guessed that we had tried him and he sought forgiveness of his lord and he fell down prostrate and turned to allah in repentance sad 3824\nand from among his signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon prostrate not to the sun nor to the moon but prostrate to him who created them if you really worship him fussilat 4137 38\nso fall down in prostration to allah and worship him alone alnajm 5362\nand when the quran is recited to them they fall not prostrate alinshiqaq 8421\nfall prostrate and draw near to allah alalaq 9619 see fiqh alsunnah by sheikh sayyid sabiq 186188\n\nscholarly views of the narration of amr ibn alas about sujud altilawah\nalalbani said in tamam alminnah 296\non the contrary the hadith is not hasan because it includes two majhul unknown narrators alhafiz said in altalkhis after quoting the opinion of almundhiri and alnawawi that it is hasan abd alhaqq and ibn qattan classed it as daif weak it includes abdallah ibn munayn who is majhul and the one who narrated from him is alharith ibn said alatqi who is also unknown ibn makula said he did not narrate any hadith apart from this one\nhence altahawi was of the opinion that there is no second sajdah in surat alhajj towards the end of the surah this is also the opinion of ibn hazm who said in almuhalla\nbecause it is not narrated in any sahih report that this was the sunnah of the messenger of allah peace and blessings of allah be upon him and there is no scholarly consensus to this effect but it was reported with a sahih isnad that umar ibn alkhattab his son abdallah and abu darda performed sajdah in the second verse quoted from surat alhajj\nthen ibn hazm discussed whether the sajdahs for the other verses quoted are prescribed in islam he mentioned that the scholars are agreed upon the first ten that performing sujud when reciting these verses is prescribed\n altahawi also reported this consensus in sharh almaani 1211 but he said that the sajdah in surat fussilat was prescribed instead of the sajdah in surat sad \nboth scholars narrated ahadith with sahih isnads from the messenger of allah peace and blessings of allah be upon him concerning the sajdahs in sad alnajm alinshiqaq and alalaq these last three are from the mufassal which is referred to in the hadith of amr mentioned above\nin conclusion even though the isnad of the hadith is weak it is supported by the consensus of the ummah which supports most of it and by sahih ahadith which support the rest of it except for the second sajdah in suat alhajj for which there is no evidence in the sunnah or in the consensus of the scholars but some of the sahabah used to prostrate when reciting it which could be taken as evidence especially since no one is known to have disputed with them in this regard\nto sum up the prostration of recitation should be performed when reciting the fifteen verses quoted above \nand allah knows best"

    "question": "the tencommandments",
    "answer": "praise be to allahthank you for your question which shows an interest in the quran we are happy to answer your question here\nthere are in the quran certain aayaat verses which some scholars call the verses of the ten commandments because they include ten important commandments given by allaah to mankind these aayaat are to be found in two passages of the quran\nthe first is in soorat alanaam where allaah says interpretation of the meaning\nsay come i will recite what your lord has prohibited you from join not anything in worship with him be good and dutiful to your parents kill not your children because of poverty we provide sustenance for you and for them come not near to alfawaahish shameful sins illegal sexual intercourse etc whether committed openly or secretly and kill not anyone whom allaah has forbidden except for a just cause according to islamic law this he has commanded you that you may understand\nand come not near to the orphans property except to improve it until he or she attains the age of full strength and give full measure and full weight with justice we burden not any person but that which he can bear and whenever you give your word ie judge between men or give evidence etc say the truth even if a near relative is concerned and fulfil the covenant of allaah this he commands you that you may remember\nand verily this ie allaahs commandments mentioned in the above two verses is my straight path so follow it and follow not other paths for they will separate you away from his path this he has ordained for you that you may become almuttaqoon the pious alanaam 6151153\nthe second passage occurs in soorat alisraa and may be considered as a commentary on the passage quoted above allaah says interpretation of the meaning\nand your lord has decreed that you worship none but him and that you be dutiful to your parents if one of them or both of them attain old age in your life say not to them a word of disrespect nor shout at them but address them in terms of honour\nand lower unto them the wing of submission and humility through mercy and say my lord bestow on them your mercy as they did bring me up when i was small\nyour lord knows best what is in your innerselves if you are righteous then verily he is ever mostforgiving to those who turn unto him again and again in obedience and in repentance\nand give to the kindred his due and to the poor and to the wayfarer but spend not wastefully your wealth in the manner of a spendthrift\nverily spendthrifts are brothers of the shayaateen devils and the shaytaan satan is ever ungrateful to his lord\nand if you turn away from them kindred poor wayfarers etc whom we have ordered you to give their rights but if you have no money at the time they ask you for it and you are awaiting a mercy from your lord for which you hope then speak unto them a soft kind word ie allaah will give to me and i will give to you\nand let not your hand be tied like a miser to your neck not stretch it forth to its utmost reach like a spendthrift so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty\ntruly your lord enlarges the provision for whom he wills and straitens for whom he wills verily he is ever allknower allseer of his slaves\nand kill not your children for fear of poverty we provide for them and for you surely the killing of them is a great sin\nand come not near to unlawful sexual intercourse verily it is a faahishah ie anything that transgresses its limits a great sin and an evil way that leads one to hell unless allaah forgives him\nand do not kill anyone which allaah has forbidden except for a just cause and whoever is killed intentionally with hostility and oppression and not by mistake we have given his heir the authority to demand qisaas law of equality in punishment or to forgive or to take diya blood money but let him not exceed limits in the matter of taking life ie he should not kill except the killer only verily he is helped by the islamic law\nand come not near to the orphans property except to improve it until he attains the age of full strength and fulfil every covenant verily the covenant will be questioned about\nand give full measure when you measure and weigh with a balance that is straight that is good advantageous and better in the end\nand follow not o man ie say not or do not or witness not etc that of which you have no knowledge verily the hearing and the sight and the heart of each of those you will be questioned by allaah\nand walk not on the earth with conceit and arrogance verily you can neither rend nor penetrate the earth nor can you attain a stature like that of the mountains in height\nall the bad aspects of these the above mentioned things are hateful to your lord\nthis is part of alhikmah wisdom good manners and high character etc which your lord has inspired to you o muhammad and set not up with allaah any other ilaah god lest you should be thrown into hell blameworthy and rejected from allaahs mercy alisraa 172339\nperhaps after enjoying reading these verses you will have a better idea of the quraan than before and this will be the beginning of a fundamental change in your life the start of your way to islam may allaah guide and help you always peace be upon those who follow true guidance"

antiislamic websites so that everyone will go and read them because this will indirectly\n    contribute to the promotion of these worthless people who claim to imitate the\n    quraan \nproducing anything like the quraan is impossible because allaah\n    challenged anyone to do this this challenge was issued to the most brilliant and eloquent\n    arab poets at the time when the quraan was revealed which was also the time when\n    arabic eloquence was at its peak allaah said interpretation of the meaning let\n    them then produce a recital like unto it the quraan if they are truthful altur\n    5234\nwhen they could not do this allaah challenged them to produce ten\n    soorahs like its soorahs or they say he muhammad forged it the\n    quraan say bring you then ten forged soorahs chapters like unto it\n    and call whomsoever you can other than allah to your help if you speak the\n    truth hud 1113  interpretation of the meaning\nwhen they could not do this allah challenged them to produce just\n    one soorah that contained the same eloquence and wisdom as the quraan he said\n    interpretation of the meaning or do they say he muhammad has forged\n    it say bring then a soorah chapter like unto it and call upon whomsoever\n    you like besides allah if you are truthful yoonus 1038\nallah called on them to seek help from whoever they wanted and to\n    accept the challenge he said interpretation of the meaning and if you arab\n    pagans jews christians are in doubt concerning that which we have sent down to our\n    slave muhammad then produce a soorah of the like thereof and call your witnesses\n    supporters and helpers besides allah if you are truthful albaqarah 223\nwhen they were unable to do this allah informed them that they\n    would never be able to do it no matter who they called upon to help them he said\n    interpretation of the meaning say if mankind and jinn were together to\n    produce the like of this quraan they could not produce the like thereof even if\n    they helped one another alisra 1788\nthere is no one except allah who can produce the like of the\n    quraan because the quraan as he says is a book the verses whereof\n    are perfected and then explained in detail from one who is allwise and wellacquainted\n    with all things hud 111  interpretation of the meaning\nwhen some liars did try to imitate the quraan they came up\n    with ridicualous nonsense that would make children laugh let alone mature and intelligent\n    adults for example the liar musaylimah said o frog daughter of two frogs croak\n    as much as you want your upper part is in the water and your lower part is in the\n    mud this is an example of the kind of thing said by him and other pretenders to\n    prophethood see sayd alkhaatir by ibn aljawzi p 404\n    some forms of falsehood may deceive some of the people\n    because of their ignorance and lack of understanding of the rules of grammar and accepted\n    styles of eloquence in arabic but anyone who has intelligence and common sense should at\n    least be able to see the difference and realize that these madeup words cannot possibly\n    be quraan if we look at the website referred to in the question we see that kufr\n    is quite clearly mentioned in these fabricated soorahs such as the statement that the\n    messiah is the son of god or is god and the promotion of the evil madhhab of raafidah a\n    kind of shiah and other such nonsense there are also some weird contradictions\n    for example these liars say in the socalled sixth aayah of the socalled soorah\n    altajassud exalted be he above taking any of his creation as a son\n    but then we find in the socalled ninth aayah of the socalled soorah\n    aleemaan the words you are he the son of god truly in you we\n    believe but verily allah has spoken the truth when he said interpretation of the\n    meaning do they not then consider the quraan carefully had it been from\n    other than allah they would surely have found therein much contradictions alnisaa\n    482\nyou also find other silly comments in these madeup soorahs such\n    as the claim that allah permitted his prophet to change whatever he wanted in the\n    quraan as in the socalled sixth aayah of the socalled soorah\n    alwasaaya abrogate whatever you want to abrogate of the commands that we\n    have given you for we permit you to make changes to our decisions\nevery muslim will realize the extent of the lies contained in these\n    words that come from this mind that is driven by ulterior motives have you ever seen\n    anything more foolish than these words allah has told us to adhere to his book and put it\n    into practice as he says interpretation of the meaning and this is a blessed\n    book which we have sent down so follow it and fear allah that you may receive\n    mercy alanaam 6155 \nhe commanded his messenger to adhere to the quraan saying\n    interpretation of the meaning so hold you muhammad to that which is inspired\n    in you verily you are on a straight path alzukhruf 4343 \nallah warned his messenger not to fail in conveying the message\n    complete and unaltered as he said interpretation of the meaning verily they\n    were about to tempt you away from that which we have revealed unto you o muhammad to\n    fabricate something other than it against us and then they would certainly have taken you\n    for a friend and had we not made you stand firm you would nearly have inclined to them a\n    little in that case we would have made you taste a double portion of punishment in\n    this life and a double portion of punishment after death and then you would have found\n    none to help you against us alisra 177375 and  if he\n    muhammad had forged a false saying concerning us allah we surely should have seized\n    him by his right hand or with power and might and then certainly should have cut off\n    his life artery aorta alhaaqqah 694446 having said all this how can\n    there be any socalled soorah that says the messenger has the right to abrogate whatever\n    he wants in the quraan and that he has the authority to change or omit whatever\n    rules he wants\nthe only one who can abrogate whatever he wants of the quraan is\n    the one who revealed it may he be glorified as he says interpretation of the meaning allah\n    blots out what he wills and confirms what he wills and with him is the mother of the\n    book alrad 1339 \nwhatever a verse revelation we abrogate or cause to be\n    forgotten we bring a better one or similar to it know you not that allah is able to do\n    all things albaqarah 2106 \nwe like our messenger are obliged to understand and implement the\n    quraan without distorting omitting or changing anything allah said interpretation\n    of the meaning this is a book which we have sent down to you full of\n    blessings that they may ponder over its verses and that men of understanding may\n    remember saad 3829\nwe have seen in the false soorahs quoted on that internet website a\n    real example of what is referred to in the aayah interpretation of the meaning and\n    verily among them is a party who distort the book with their tongues as they read so\n    that you may think it is from the book but it is not from the book and they say\n    this is from allah but it is not from allah and they speak a lie against\n    allah while they know it aal imraan 378 \nwe ask allah to make his religion and his book prevail and to make his\n    friends victorious as we ask him to defeat and humiliate his enemies and cause them to\n    fail may allah bless our prophet muhammad"

then this punishment was \nabrogated and replaced with whipping or stoning something similar was reported from \nikrimah said ibn jubayr alhasan ataa alkhurasani abu saalih qutaadah zayd ibn \naslam and aldahhak stating that this is abrogated and this is agreed upon imam ahmad said \nmuhammad ibn jafar told us that said told us from qutaadah from alhasan from hattaan \nibn abdullah alraqaashi from ubaadah ibn alsaamit who said whenever the wahy \nrevelation descended upon the messenger of allah \n peace  blessings of allaah be upon him it affected him the stress showed on \nhim and his face would change allah sent a revelation to him one day and when it was over he \nsaid  listen to me allah has made another way for them when a married man commits \nadultery with a married woman and an unmarried man with an unmarried woman then in the \ncase of married persons there is a punishment of one hundred lashes and then stoning to \ndeath and in the case of unmarried persons the punishment is one hundred lashes and exile \nfor one year it was reported by muslim and other narrators of sunan via qutaadah from \nalhasan from alhattan from ubaadah ibn alsaamit from the prophet \n peace  blessings of allaah be upon him with the wording \nreceive teaching from me receive teaching from me allah has made another way for those \nwomen when an unmarried man commits adultery with an unmarried woman they should \nreceive one hundred lashes and banishment for one year in the case of a married male \ncommitting adultery with a married female they should receive one hundred lashes and be \nstoned to death altirmidhi said this is a saheeh hasan hadeeth \nalqurtubi may allah have mercy on him said in his tafseer of this aayah\nthis confinement was the first punishment for adultery at the beginning of islam ibn \nabbas and alhasan said ibn zayd added they would not be allowed to marry until they \ndied as a punishment for them when they asked to marry someone else this ruling applied for \na while then the prophet \n peace  blessings of allaah be upon him said according to the hadeeth narrated by ubaadah ibn alsaamit \nreceive teaching from me receive teaching from me allah has made another way for those \nwomen when an unmarried man commits adultery with an unmarried woman they should \nreceive one hundred lashes and banishment for one year in the case of a married male \ncommitting adultery with a married female they should receive one hundred lashes and be \nstoned to death some of the scholars said the idea of punishment and shame was still there \nwith the lashing because there is no contradiction and they are applied to one person as for \nconfinement this is abrogated by the consensus of the scholars and allah knows best \nto complete the benefit of what has been said it is appropriate to learn the tafseer of the next \naayah in surat alnisaa\nif two men among you are guilty of lewdness punish them both if they repent and amend \nleave them alone for allah is oft returning most merciful alnisaa 416\nibn katheer may allah have mercy on him said in his tafseer of this aayah\nif two men among you are guilty of lewdness means two who commit an immoral act so \nthey should be punished ibn abbas may allah be pleased with him saeed ibn jubayr and \nothers said ie by putting them to public shame and hitting them with shoes this was the \nruling until allah abrogated it and replaced it with lashing and stoning ikrimah ataa \nalhasan and abdullah ibn katheer said this was revealed concerning a man and a woman \nwho commit adultery the phrase if they repent and amend means if they give up what they \nwere doing and mend their ways leave them alone means not to keep rebuking them with \nugly words after that because the one who has repented from his sin is like one who never \nsinned at all allah is oft returning most merciful  it was proven in the two saheehs if the \nslave woman of one of you commits adultery apply the punishment of lashing and do not \nblame her after that  ie do not blame her for what she did after the punishment has been \ngiven because the punishment is an expiation for her deed"
