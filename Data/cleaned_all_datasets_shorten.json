    "answer": "Reading books by fortunetellers and astrologers is forbidden (haraam) in Islam. It is not permissible to ask them questions or believe in their predictions, as this constitutes disbelief (kufr). The Prophet (peace be upon him) warned against such practices, stating that prayers will not be accepted for forty days if one consults a fortuneteller. This applies even if one does not believe them, but believing them is even more severe."
  },
  {
    "question": "a response to one who claims that allah loves to punish and torment people",
    "answer": "Allah is the Most Merciful and does not love to punish people. Such a claim is false and contradicts Islamic teachings. Allah's mercy precedes His wrath, and He punishes only those who persist in wrongdoing after guidance has been made clear. The Quran and Hadith emphasize Allah's compassion and justice, and He rewards good deeds while warning against evil."
  },
  {
    "question": "the abhorrent nature of shirk",
    "answer": "Shirk (associating partners with Allah) is the gravest sin in Islam. It is inherently evil and corrupts faith. While shirk is always blameworthy, divine punishment for it only becomes due after proof is established against the individual. The Quran and Hadith clearly condemn shirk, and it nullifies a person's good deeds."
  },
  {
    "question": "response to those who say that worship is accepted from everyone no matter what his belief",
    "answer": "Worship is only accepted from those who believe in Allah and follow His guidance.

True worship requires sincerity and adherence to Islamic teachings."
  },
  {
    "question": "can telomeres prevent death",

  },
  {
    "question": "thinking in islam",
    "answer": "Islam encourages rational thinking and reflection. The Quran repeatedly calls people to ponder its verses and the creation of the heavens and earth. Critical thinking is an act of worship when directed toward understanding Allah's signs. However, Muslims should avoid specious arguments that undermine faith."
  },
  {
    "question": "why do muslims kiss the black stone",
    "answer": "Muslims kiss the Black Stone (Hajar al-Aswad) during Hajj or Umrah as an act of following the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him). It is not worshiped but venerated as a historical relic. Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) clarified that it is a stone with no power, and the act is purely symbolic of obedience to Allah's commands."
  },
  {
    "question": "is testifying that muhammad is the messenger of allah equal to testifying that there is no god but allah",
    "answer": "Yes, the two testimonies (Shahadatayn) are inseparable pillars of Islam. Both are essential for entering Islam, and one's faith is incomplete without affirming both. The first declares Allah's oneness, and the second affirms the prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him). Together, they form the foundation of Islamic belief."
  },
  {
    "question": "every monotheist will enter paradise so why should the muslims strive",
    "answer": "While monotheists who die as believers will enter Paradise, striving in good deeds is essential. Deeds determine one's rank in Paradise, and neglecting obligations can lead to punishment. Islam emphasizes balance: trust in Allah's mercy while fulfilling duties. Laziness contradicts the Quranic command to work righteousness."
  },
  {
    "question": "going to horoscope pages and channels in order to refute them",
    "answer": "It is forbidden to visit horoscope pages or engage with astrology, as it involves disbelief. However, scholars may refute such content if qualified to do so, with the intention of guiding others. Laypeople should avoid such platforms to protect their faith, as exposure can lead to doubt or sin."
  },
  {
    "question": "is it obligatory to entrust all our affairs to allah",
    "answer": "Yes, Muslims must entrust all affairs to Allah (Tawakkul) while also taking permissible means. Reliance on Allah does not negate effort; rather, it combines trust with action. The Prophet (peace be upon him) taught that one should tie their camel and then trust Allah, illustrating the balance between effort and faith."
  },
  {
    "question": "on the issue of whether ignorance is a valid excuse",
    "answer": "Ignorance can be a valid excuse in matters of faith if the person had no access to correct knowledge. However, those who neglect learning despite the availability of resources are not excused. Allah does not punish until guidance is made clear, but Muslims are obligated to seek knowledge and avoid negligence."
  },
  {
    "question": "woman in islam is for the purpose of building a life that is based on obedience to allah and is not to be looked at merely as a sexual object",
    "answer": "Women in Islam are honored as equal partners in faith and life. Their purpose is to worship Allah and contribute to society, not to be objectified. The Quran and Hadith emphasize women's rights, dignity, and spiritual equality. Islam condemns reducing women to mere objects of desire and promotes mutual respect between genders."
  },
  {
    "question": "the secret and the law of attraction",
    "answer": "The book 'The Secret' promotes ideas contrary to Islam, such as pantheism and reliance on wishful thinking instead of Allah. Islam teaches that success comes through faith, lawful effort, and divine decree (Qadr). Muslims should avoid such philosophies and rely solely on Allah while taking practical steps toward their goals."
  },
  {
    "question": "what is the ruling on wearing a cross in order to conceal ones identity in the airport",
    "answer": "Wearing a cross is forbidden in Islam as it symbolizes disbelief. Concealing one's identity by wearing religious symbols of other faiths is only permissible under extreme compulsion (e.g., threat to life). Otherwise, Muslims should uphold their identity and avoid imitating non-Islamic practices, as this contradicts Islamic teachings."
  },
  {
    "question": "guidelines on forms of the cross that are prohibited",
    "answer": "All forms of the cross are prohibited if they are intended as religious symbols. Decorative crosses or designs not meant as symbols of Christianity may be permissible if they do not resemble the traditional cross. Muslims should avoid any shape that could be interpreted as veneration of the cross, as it represents beliefs contrary to Islam."
  },
  {
    "question": "he apostatised during the day in ramadan then he came back to islam what must he do",
    "answer": "If someone apostatizes and then returns to Islam, they must repent sincerely and make up for the fasts missed during their apostasy. Expiation is not required unless the fast was broken by sexual intercourse. The key is sincere repentance and reaffirmation of faith, along with fulfilling missed obligations."
  },
  {
    "question": "what is the evidence that islam is true",
    "answer": "Islam's truth is evidenced by its alignment with human nature (Fitrah), rational proofs, miracles of the Quran, prophecies fulfilled, and the perfect character of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The Quran's linguistic excellence, scientific accuracy, and timeless guidance further prove its divine origin. Islam's teachings are consistent and universally applicable."
  },
  {
    "question": "some criticisms of the belief of ibn rushd averroes",
    "answer": "Ibn Rushd (Averroes) faced criticism for blending Aristotelian philosophy with Islamic theology, leading to esoteric interpretations of religious texts. Scholars like Ibn Taymiyyah opposed his views on resurrection, divine attributes, and the reconciliation of philosophy with revelation. His approach was seen as undermining clear Islamic teachings."
  },
  {
    "question": "shari evidence that the one who is ignorant is excused with regard to issues of shirk and kufr",
    "answer": "Islamic texts show that ignorance can excuse one from accountability in matters of shirk and kufr if they had no access to correct knowledge. Allah says, 'We never punish until We send a messenger' (Quran 17:15). However, those who willfully neglect learning or reject truth after guidance are not excused."
  },
  {
    "question": "the view of shaykh ibn uthaymeen regarding the excuse of ignorance",
    "answer": "Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen held that ignorance is a valid excuse in matters of faith if the person had no means to learn the truth. However, negligence in seeking knowledge or stubbornness after guidance negates this excuse. He emphasized that proof must be clearly established before deeming someone a disbeliever."
  },
  {
    "question": "is there scholarly consensus on all ten things which nullify islam that were mentioned by imam muhammad ibn abd alwahhaab",
    "answer": "There is consensus on nine of the ten nullifiers of Islam listed by Imam Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, such as shirk and denying obligatory practices. The tenth—sihr (magic)—is debated, though certain forms (e.g., using magic to harm others) are unanimously considered disbelief. Overall, these nullifiers are well-grounded in Quran and Sunnah."
  },
  {
    "question": "is there scholarly consensus on all ten things which nullify islam that were mentioned by imam muhammad ibn abd alwahhaab",
    "answer": "There is scholarly consensus on nine of the ten things that nullify Islam as mentioned by Imam Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab. The exception is sihr (magic/witchcraft), which is subject to further discussion. The nullifiers include shirk (associating partners with Allah), ascribing intermediaries to Allah, not regarding mushrikeen as disbelievers, believing someone's guidance is better than the Prophet's, hating aspects of the Prophet's teachings, ridiculing religion, supporting non-Muslims against Muslims, believing it's permissible to follow other religions, and turning away from Allah's religion."
  },
  {
    "question": "extraordinary events that happen at the hands of nonmuslims are a test and a trial",
    "answer": "Extraordinary events performed by non-Muslims are a test and trial. They should not be taken as proof of truth, as even the Dajjal will perform such feats. Many such events are tricks or illusions. True miracles (karaamaat) are granted by Allah to righteous believers, while false feats may be aided by devils or magic."
  },
  {
    "question": "what is the ruling on calling an illegitimate child after the father",
    "answer": "Scholars differ on attributing an illegitimate child to the father. The majority view is that the child is not to be attributed to the father, while others permit it if the father acknowledges the child. The child is always linked to the mother and inherits from her."
  },
  {
    "question": "guidelines regarding the kind of misinterpretation that does not constitute kufr on the part of the one who follows that misinterpretation and some other comments on this issue",
    "answer": "Misinterpretation based on sincere effort (ijtihaad) does not constitute kufr if the person seeks truth and follows linguistic and scholarly principles. However, misinterpretation undermining core Islamic beliefs (e.g., Tawheed, Resurrection) is unacceptable. Differences in secondary matters are excused."
  },
  {
    "question": "weakness of the hadeeth the bonds of islam and the foundations of the faith are three",
    "answer": "The hadith stating 'the bonds of Islam and the foundations of the faith are three' is weak (daeef) due to issues in its chain. It is likely mawqoof (attributed to a companion, not the Prophet). A stronger hadith mentions Islam's shares as prayer, fasting, and zakat."
  },
  {
    "question": "her husband denounced her as a disbeliever because she will not denounce people as disbelievers",
    "answer": "Denouncing someone as a disbeliever for not labeling others as disbelievers is incorrect unless the matter is clear (e.g., rejecting Tawheed). The marriage remains valid, and the husband's claim is flawed. Advise him kindly and refer him to scholars to correct his understanding."
  },
  {
    "question": "why do we not say that the big bang came before everything else",
    "answer": "The Big Bang theory itself states time and space began with it, so nothing preceded it. Attributing creation to the Big Bang without a Creator is irrational. Allah, the Necessary Existent, is the First Cause, beyond the universe's limitations."
  },
  {
    "question": "the hadith woe to ammaar he will be killed by the transgressing group he will be calling them to paradise and they will be calling him to hell and refutation of the specious argument which quotes it to cast aspersions upon muaawiyah",
    "answer": "The hadith about Ammar being killed by the 'transgressing group' refers to the Battle of Siffin. It does not imply disbelief for Muawiyah's followers, as they acted on ijtihaad. Both groups were Muslims, though Ali's side was closer to truth. The hadith warns against division, not eternal damnation."
  },
  {
    "question": "ruling on studying psychology and law",
    "answer": "Studying psychology and secular law is permissible if the aim is to critique or refute non-Islamic ideas. However, it is forbidden if it leads to adopting un-Islamic beliefs. Muslims should prioritize Islamic sciences and seek knowledge from trustworthy scholars."
  },
  {
    "question": "can he continue to follow the hanafi madhhab and how can he determine which view is correct",
    "answer": "Yes, one may follow the Hanafi madhhab while adhering to Quran and Sunnah. To determine correctness, compare views with clear Islamic texts and consult reliable scholars. Avoid isolated or weak opinions within the madhhab."
  },
  {
    "question": "definition of the islamic character and its main features and a warning against spoiling or distorting it",
    "answer": "Islamic character is based on Quran and Sunnah, emphasizing sincerity, honesty, modesty, and kindness. It is rooted in Tawheed and submission to Allah. Distortion occurs through foreign philosophies or cultural practices. Preserve it by learning authentic Islamic teachings."

  },
  {
    "question": "death of an elderly person cause calamity or a decrease in barakah blessing for his surviving family members",
    "answer": "Death is a test, but the claim that an elderly person's death reduces barakah for the family is baseless. Barakah depends on Allah's will and the family's piety, not age."
  },
  {
    "question": "why are most of the people on earth disbelievers and why does allah want them to enter hell",
    "answer": "Most people choose disbelief despite clear evidence. Allah does not desire their punishment but grants free will. Hell is a consequence of their rejection, not Allah's desire. Mercy is offered to those who repent."
  },
  {
    "question": "praying behind someone who writes amulets",
    "answer": "Praying behind someone who writes amulets is permissible if the amulets contain Quranic verses or permissible duaas. If they involve shirk (e.g., calling on jinn), it is forbidden. Advise such imams to stop this practice."

    "question": "what are the degrees of islam",
    "answer": "Islam has three degrees: 1) Islam (outward submission), 2) Iman (faith in heart and actions), 3) Ihsan (worshipping as if seeing Allah). Each level deepens one's connection to Allah."
  },
  {
    "question": "ruling on one who apostatises repeatedly",
    "answer": "Repeated apostasy requires sincere repentance each time. Allah forgives if repentance is genuine, but persistent disbelief until death leads to eternal punishment. Scholars differ on worldly rulings for such cases."
  },
  {
    "question": "ruling on the wife of one who reviles religion",
    "answer": "Reviling religion is apostasy. The wife of such a person is not automatically divorced but becomes forbidden to him until he repents. If he repents before her 'iddah ends, she returns to him; otherwise, she is free to marry another."
  },
  {
    "question": "can ahaad hadiths be accepted with regard to aqeedah",
    "answer": "Ahaad hadiths can be accepted in matters of aqeedah if supported by corroborating evidence. The Prophet (peace be upon him) sent individuals to teach aqeedah, and rejecting ahaad reports could invalidate many Shariah rulings."
  },
  {
    "question": "atheism is a greater sin than shirk",
    "answer": "Atheism, which denies Allah's existence, is worse than shirk (associating partners with Allah). Atheists reject Allah entirely, while mushrikeen at least acknowledge Him but wrongly associate others with Him."
  },
  {
    "question": "is it obligatory to obey a ruler who does not rule according to the book of allaah and the sunnah of his messenger blessings and peace of allaah be upon him",
    "answer": "Muslims must obey rulers in matters not involving disobedience to Allah. If the ruler commits blatant kufr, it becomes obligatory to oppose him. Otherwise, rebellion is forbidden unless the ruler meets two conditions: knowing Allah's ruling and rejecting it out of belief that another ruling is better."
  },
  {
    "question": "what is kufr and what are its various kinds",
    "answer": "Kufr means disbelief in Allah and His Messenger. It includes denial, hypocrisy, arrogance, and doubt. Major kufr puts one beyond Islam, while minor kufr does not. Types include kufr of denial, hypocrisy, turning away, and doubt."
  },
  {
    "question": "did prophet muhammad see allah",
    "answer": "Most companions believed the Prophet (peace be upon him) did not see Allah with his eyes during Mi'raj. Aisha and Abu Dharr reported he saw light but not Allah directly. Ibn Abbas mentioned he saw Allah with his heart, not his eyes."
  },
  {
    "question": "ruling on sitting with one who does not pray and who denies that hijab is obligatory and mocks it and mocks aaishah may allaah be pleased with her",
    "answer": "Such a person commits major kufr. It is not permissible to sit with them unless advising them to repent. Their company should be avoided, and initiating greetings is forbidden. Mocking hijab or Aisha is apostasy."
  },
  {
    "question": "conditions of righteous deeds",
    "answer": "Righteous deeds must be: 1) Done sincerely for Allah, 2) In accordance with the Sunnah, 3) Based on sound belief. Without these, deeds are invalid. Allah rejects actions not meeting these conditions."
  },
  {
    "question": "was a window opened above the prophets grave for rain",
